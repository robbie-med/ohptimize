# Tension-type headache

### Quick guide

### Diagnostic approach

Evaluate for signs of high-risk headache.

Rule out red flags for headache.

Evaluate for diagnostic criteria for tension-type headaches.

Neurological exam

Palpation of pericranial muscles

Symptom diary (if recurrent)

### Red flag features

Sudden onset (i.e., thunderclap headache)

Systemic symptoms (e.g., fever)

Neurological deficits

Age > 50 years at onset

Pattern change or recent onset

Positional headache

Signs of increased ICP (e.g., papilledema)

Posttraumatic onset

### Management checklist

NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen DOSAGE , naproxen DOSAGE , diclofenac DOSAGE )

Aspirin DOSAGE

Acetaminophen DOSAGE

Counsel against medication use > 15 days/month.

Lifestyle modifications (e.g., stress reduction, sleep hygiene)

Consider prophylactic amitriptyline for chronic and/or frequent episodic TTH.

### Summary

Tension-type headache (TTH) is a primary headache disorder and the most common type of headache overall. Tension-type headaches are characterized by a dull, nonpulsating, band-like pain that is often bilateral. Autonomic symptoms like photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea are usually not present. Depending on the frequency and duration of episodes, tension-type headaches are classified as episodic or chronic. Infrequent episodic tension-type headaches are treated with NSAIDs, while chronic and frequent episodic forms may benefit from prophylactic amitriptyline. Nonpharmacological treatment options include lifestyle modification (e.g., stress reduction) and cognitive behavioral therapy.

### Epidemiology

- Occurrence

- Most common type of headache

- ∼ 86% of the population will have had at least one episode in their lifetime. [1][2]

- Sex: : ♀ > ♂ [2]

- Peak incidence: 30–39 years [3]

Epidemiological data refers to the US, unless otherwise specified.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Etiology

- The exact pathophysiology of tension headaches remains unknown.

- Exacerbating factors: fatigue, lack of sleep, poor posture, anxiety, stress, depression [4]

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Clinical features

- Episodic nature

- Headaches last 30 minutes to a couple of days. [4]

- Holocranial or bifrontal, band-like headache (mild to moderate intensity)

- Dull, pressing, nonpulsating ("vise-like”) quality

- Headache does not increase with exertion.

- Maximum of one autonomic symptom (phonophobia or photophobia)

- No nausea, vomiting, or aura

- Palpation of muscles of the head may reveal increased pericranial tenderness.

### Diagnosis

Tension-type headache is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on a history of typical features and normal neurological examination. Severe underlying conditions should be ruled out (see red flags for headache and “Diagnostics” in “Headache”). A headache diary can be helpful to establish the diagnosis and guide management.  [5]

### Diagnostic criteria for tension-type headaches [4][5]

- At least two of the following:

- Dull, pressing, nonpulsating quality

- Mild to moderate intensity

- Bilateral

- No increase in intensity with exertion

- Not better explained by any other headache disorder

- Categorized into three entities (which guide treatment); all criteria have to be fulfilled for the diagnosis [4]

| Frequency | ≥ 10 episodes < 1 day/month or < 12 days/year | ≥ 10 episodes on 1–14 days/month For > 3 months (≥ 12 and < 180 days/year) | ≥ 15 days/month For > 3 months (≥ 180 days/year) |
| Duration | 30 minutes to 7 days | 30 minutes to 7 days | Hours–days May be continuous |
| Autonomic symptoms | No nausea or vomiting No more than one of photophobia or phonophobia | Only one of the following: Photophobia Phonophobia Mild nausea No moderate or severe nausea or vomiting |

Tension-type headaches may be difficult to differentiate from mild forms of migraine without aura, and some patients may have both disorders. [4]

### Treatment

### General principles [4]

Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies can be used for the treatment of tension-type headache. In addition, any underlying conditions (e.g., depression) should be identified and treated.

- Pharmacological therapy

- Episodic tension-type headache: NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin) or acetaminophen

- Chronic tension-type headache;  and frequent episodic type: consider prophylactic therapy (e.g., with amitriptyline).

- All types of tension-type headache:

- Triptans are not indicated for the treatment of isolated TTH.  [5]

- Opioids should be avoided. [5]

- Non-pharmacological therapy: Consider if there is a significant decrease in patient's quality of life.

- Lifestyle and behavioral modification (e.g., exercise, weight reduction)

- Psychobehavioral treatments (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation training)

Avoid prolonged use (> 15 days/month) of NSAIDs for chronic tension headache, as this may cause medication overuse headaches. [4]

### Pharmacological therapy

## Episodic tension-type headache [5][6]

- One of the following NSAIDs:

- Ibuprofen DOSAGE

- Naproxen DOSAGE

- Diclofenac DOSAGE

- Aspirin DOSAGE

- Ketorolac IM DOSAGE   [5]

- Acetaminophen DOSAGE

- Caffeine DOSAGE  can be used in combination with ibuprofen or acetaminophen to augment the analgetic effect.  [5]

- Counsel patient against taking acute pain medication for more than 15 days/month to avoid medication overuse headache.

Opioids are not recommended for tension-type headaches and increase the risk of developing medication overuse headache. [5]

## Prophylactic therapy for chronic tension-type headache and frequent episodic tension-type headache [5][6]

- First-line: amitriptyline DOSAGE

- Second-line [5]

- Mirtazapine DOSAGE

- Venlafaxine DOSAGE

### Nonpharmacological treatment [5][7]

- Lifestyle and behavioral changes (identification and management of triggers)

- Reduction of caffeine intake

- Smoking cessation

- Stress reduction

- Sleep hygiene

- Physical activity

- Treatment of underlying conditions (e.g., depression)

- Additional nonpharmacological therapies include:  [5]

- Biofeedback

- Relaxation training (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation)

- Cognitive behavioral therapy

- Physical therapy (including posture training, massage, spinal manipulation)

- Acupuncture
