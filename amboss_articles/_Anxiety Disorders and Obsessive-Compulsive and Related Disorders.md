### Summary
Anxiety disorders cover a broad spectrum of conditions characterized by excessive and persistent fear (an emotional response to real or perceived imminent threats), anxiety (the anticipation of a future threat), worry (apprehensive expectation), and/or avoidance behavior. The etiology of anxiety disorders is multifactorial and may involve genetic, developmental, environmental, and psychosocial factors. Therapy typically consists of a combination of pharmacotherapy, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).CollapseNotesFeedback
### Overview

### Description

- Excessive and persistent fear (an emotional response to real or perceived imminent threats), anxiety (the anticipation of a future threat), worry (apprehensive expectation), and/or avoidance behavior

- Physical manifestations that are disproportionate to the real magnitude of the trigger

- Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, and selective mutism.

### Generalized anxiety disorder

### Definition

- An anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and persistent anxiety for ≥ 6 months

- Symptoms can be triggered in various situations, with or without an identifiable stressor, and cause significant social or occupational dysfunction.

### Epidemiology [1]

- Lifetime prevalence: 4–7% [2]

- Typically adult onset  [1]

- ♀ > ♂ (2:1) [3]

### Clinical features [2]

- Prolonged, excessive, pervasive worrying and anxiety

- Nervousness, restlessness

- Irritability

- Muscle tension

- Somnolence, fatigue

- Concentration difficulties

- Insomnia

- Medically unexplained physical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, racing heart)

### Screening [4][5]

- Indicated for all individuals aged 8–64 years.  [4][5]

- Screening tools include:

- Adults: GAD-2 , GAD-7

- Postpartum individuals: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) anxiety subscale   [6]

- Children and adolescents: Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders [4][7][8]

GAD-2 anxiety scaleGAD-7 anxiety scaleEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale

### Diagnostics [2][9]

## Approach

- Consider GAD in those with a positive screening or who express pervasive worrying, anxiety, and/or medically unexplained physical symptoms.

- Perform a complete patient history and physical examination.

- Consider diagnostic studies to rule out organic causes.

- Confirm the diagnosis using the DSM-5 criteria for GAD.

- Assess for psychiatric and medical comorbidities, including substance use disorder.

- Evaluate suicide risk.

- Consult psychiatry if there is diagnostic uncertainty or concern for comorbid psychiatric conditions.

Up to 80% of individuals with GAD have a psychiatric comorbidity, e.g., major depressive disorder or social anxiety disorder. [1][2]

## Exclusion of organic causes [2]

Consider the following studies based on clinical suspicion.

- Thyroid function tests to rule out thyroid disease

- CBC to rule out anemia

- ECG to rule out acute coronary syndromes

- Urine drug screen to rule out substance use or poisoning

- Plasma free metanephrines in patients with a family history or clinical features of pheochromocytoma

## DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GAD [3]

Diagnosis is confirmed in individuals who meet all of the following criteria.

- Excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events and/or activities (e.g., school, work) on most days for ≥ 6 months

- Worry that is difficult to control

- ≥ 3 (in adults) or ≥ 1 (in children) of the following symptoms occurring on most days over the past 6 months:

- Sleep disturbances

- Muscle tension

- Irritability

- Difficulty concentrating

- Fatiguing easily

- Restlessness

- Symptoms that cause significant distress or impairment in the professional, social, or other important areas

- Symptoms not attributable to substance use, a medical disorder (e.g., pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism), or other psychiatric conditions (e.g., panic disorder, PTSD, somatic symptom and related disorders)

### Differential diagnoses [2]

- Other anxiety disorders

- Anxiety due to another medical condition

- Panic disorder

- Panic attacks in GAD are generally precipitated by the uncontrolled escalation of anxiety and/or worry.

- Panic attacks in panic disorder are sudden and unexpected.

- Social anxiety disorder: Patients with GAD are usually comfortable in social situations and are not particularly anxious about public scrutiny.

- Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder

- Acute stress disorder, PTSD

- OCD

- Mood disorders, e.g., major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder

- Individuals with GAD tend to worry about the future, whereas those with MDD are typically anxious about the past.

- Mood swings and suicidal ideation are uncommon in GAD.

- Substance withdrawal, e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids

### Management [2][9]

## General principles

- Therapeutic options for GAD are psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy.

- Lifestyle modifications can help reduce and/or prevent symptoms.

- Treatment response is measured using validated tools, e.g., GAD-7.

- Consider indications for specialist referral, e.g., no improvement after first-line treatment.

- Consider hospitalization for patients with intractable symptoms and/or suicidal ideation.

A combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is more effective than either treatment approach alone. [9]
GAD-7 anxiety scale

## Psychotherapy

- CBT (preferred)

- May include exposure therapy, psychoeducation, goal setting, relaxation, and/or cognitive restructuring

- Typically 12 sessions with homework [2]

- Other options include supportive psychotherapy, applied relaxation therapy, psychodynamic therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and biofeedback.

## Pharmacotherapy [2]

- First-line agents

- SSRIs, e.g., escitalopram DOSAGE , paroxetine DOSAGE , sertraline (off-label) DOSAGE  [2]

- SNRIs, e.g., duloxetine DOSAGE , venlafaxine DOSAGE

- If no improvement after 8 weeks at the therapeutic dose: Switch to a different first-line agent.

- Alternative agents may be considered if there is no improvement with first-line therapy.

- Buspirone DOSAGE

- Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, diazepam) for short-term use only

- Pregabalin

- Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, quetiapine)

- Hydroxyzine

- TCAs, e.g., imipramine

Cannabis can trigger psychiatric disorders, and there is no scientific evidence to recommend its use in patients with anxiety disorders. [9]
Long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with significant adverse effects (e.g., motor and cognitive impairment) and risk of dependence. [2]
Don't get anxious if the BUS doesn’t arrive at ONE; just take a BUSpirONE.

## Lifestyle modifications

- Sleep hygiene

- Exercise

- Avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and recreational drugs

- Smoking cessation

- Mindfulness (meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction)

## Indications for referral

Refer to a psychiatrist in any of the following situations.

- The patient has comorbid psychiatric and/or substance use disorders.

- There is no improvement with first-line treatment, i.e., a full course of CBT and/or 1–2 trials of SSRI or SNRI.

- Long-term benzodiazepines, TCAs, or antipsychotics are being considered.

- The patient does not tolerate pharmacotherapy.

### Diagnostics

- Clinical diagnosis based on typical clinical features and the exclusion of organic causes of symptoms [12][13]

- Consider basic investigations, e.g. : [12]

- CBC

- BMP

- Thyroid function tests

- Serum and urine toxicology screen

- ECG

- Consider further targeted investigation if an underlying medical cause is suspected (see “Differential diagnosis”).

### Differential diagnoses

- Differential diagnosis of chest pain

- Differential diagnosis of dyspnea

- Differential diagnosis of syncope and presyncope

- Differential diagnoses of stroke

- Differential diagnosis of abdominal pain

- Differential diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias

- Differential diagnosis of sepsis

### Management of acute panic attack [14][15]

- Rule out life-threatening causes of symptoms, e.g.:

- Red flags in dyspnea

- Red flags in chest pain

- Thyroid storm

- Immediate interventions may include:

- Reassurance

- Deep breathing and relaxation techniques

- Short-acting benzodiazepine (e.g., alprazolam  DOSAGE ) if nonpharmacological intervention fails

- See also “Acute management” in “Hyperventilation syndrome” and “Approach to the agitated or violent patient.”

- Once life-threatening causes are excluded, consider discharge to primary care or psychiatry for close follow-up. [12]

- Evaluate for underlying psychiatric disorder and assess suicidal risk.

- See “Management” in “Panic disorder” for long-term treatment of recurrent panic attacks.

Panic attacks typically self-resolve within 30 minutes of onset and may not require acute intervention. [14]

### Panic disorder

### Definition

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks in addition to a ≥ 1-month period of persistent worry about experiencing additional attacks or their consequences, and/or maladaptive behavior to avoid further episodes.

### Epidemiology [16]

Panic disorder severity scale (PDSS)

## Psychotherapy [17][18]

- CBT is the preferred modality.

- Consider especially for patients who decline or do not tolerate pharmacotherapy.

- Effectiveness is similar to pharmacotherapy.

## Pharmacotherapy

- First-line

- SSRIs, e.g., paroxetine DOSAGE , sertraline DOSAGE

- SNRIs, e.g., venlafaxine DOSAGE

- Additional agents include:

- Benzodiazepines, e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, or diazepam, for short-term use only

- TCAs

Cannabis can trigger psychiatric disorders, and there is no scientific evidence to recommend its use in patients with anxiety disorders.
Long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with an increased risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. [18]

## Indications for referral

Refer to a psychiatrist in any of the following situations.

- There is no improvement with first-line pharmacotherapy.

- The patient does not tolerate pharmacotherapy.

- The patient has comorbid psychiatric and/or substance use disorders.

- Long-term benzodiazepines or alternative agents (e.g., TCAs) are being considered.

### Social anxiety disorder

### Definition [3]

Social anxiety disorder is characterized by intense and disproportionate fear and/or anxiety of social situations in which the individual may be scrutinized or judged (e.g., meeting new people, parties, eating in public) that lasts for ≥ 6 months.

### Epidemiology

- One of the most common psychiatric conditions

- 13% lifetime prevalence [19]

- Peak incidence: adolescence and early adulthood

- ♀ > ♂ (2:1)

### Subtypes

- Performance-only social anxiety disorder: : an anxiety disorder characterized by intense fear and/or anxiety related to speaking or performing in public

- Paruresis (shy bladder syndrome): the inability to urinate in the presence of others [20]

### Clinical features

- In children [3]

- Refusing to speak at social events, crying, throwing a tantrum, clinging to caregiver

- Symptoms occur both in peer settings and with adults.

### Diagnostics [19]

## Approach

- Consider screening individuals with other psychiatric or substance use disorders by asking about:

- Avoidance of social situations or activities

- Feeling anxious or embarrassed in social situations

- Confirm the diagnosis using the DSM-5 criteria.

- Assess for comorbidities, e.g., MDD, substance use disorders.

Individuals with social anxiety disorder often do not seek medical care for their psychological symptoms.

## DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder [3]

Diagnosis is confirmed in individuals who meet all of the following criteria.

- Significant fear or anxiety related to social situations in which scrutiny by others is anticipated (e.g., conversing with or meeting unfamiliar people, eating or giving a speech in front of others)

- Fear of behaving in ways that will lead to negative judgment by others

- Fear or anxiety that is almost always triggered by social situations

- Avoidance of or intense anxiety during social situations

- Fear or anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual threat

- Symptoms that persist for ≥ 6 months

- Symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational)

- Symptoms not attributable to or better explained by substance use or another psychiatric or medical condition

### Differential diagnoses [19]

- Other anxiety disorders

- Agoraphobia

- Panic disorder

- Generalized anxiety disorder

- Separation anxiety disorder

- Shyness as a personality trait

- Medical conditions that cause embarrassing symptoms (e.g., incontinence, tremor)

- Avoidant personality disorder

### Management [19][21]

Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy can be offered together or alone based on patient preferences and clinical judgment.

- Psychotherapy: : CBT is the most effective type.

- Pharmacotherapy

- Social anxiety disorder

- First-line agents: SSRIs,;  e.g., paroxetine DOSAGE , sertraline DOSAGE  or SNRIs, e.g., venlafaxine DOSAGE

- Alternative agents: benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam), pregabalin, phenelzine

- Performance-only social anxiety disorder: as needed 30–60 minutes before anxiety-inducing event

- Beta blockers, e.g., propranolol (off-label) DOSAGE  [19]

- OR Benzodiazepines, e.g., clonazepam

CBT combined with pharmacotherapy provides more rapid and long-lasting improvement of social anxiety disorder than CBT alone. [19]

- Definition: pronounced fear or anxiety of being in situations that are perceived as difficult to escape from or situations in which it might be difficult to seek help

- Epidemiology

- ♀ > ♂ (2:1)

- Age of onset: < 35 years (60–70% of cases)

- Clinical features

### Hyperventilation syndrome

### Background [26][27][28]

- Definition: : a condition characterized by an increase in minute ventilation that exceeds metabolic demands without a clear organic precipitant

- Etiology: : frequently associated with panic disorder and anxiety disorder

- Pathophysiology: hyperventilation → hypocarbia → respiratory alkalosis [29]

### Clinical features [30]

- Cardinal feature: transient hyperventilation

- Additional symptoms include:

- Dizziness, lightheadedness

- Chest pain, palpitations

- Paresthesias (typically in extremities and/or the perioral area)

- Carpopedal spasm

- Anxiety, sense of impending doom

### Diagnostics [30][31]

Hyperventilation syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- Pulse oximetry: SpO2 is usually normal.

- Capnography (if available): low EtCO2 initially (normalizes as the episode resolves)

- Tests to rule out an organic cause may include:

- Bedside tests

- POC glucose

- ECG

- Peak expiratory flow

- Laboratory tests

- CBC

- BMP (including calculation of anion gap)

- VBG or ABG

- Imaging (as indicated by clinical suspicion), e.g.:

- CXR

- CT angiogram chest

- CT head

- Offer patient reassurance and if possible, remove stressors.

- Breathing retraining: Focus on diaphragmatic breathing.

- Second-line: short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam DOSAGE ) if nonpharmacological interventions fail.

- Interventions to reduce pH directly are typically not necessary.

- See also “Management of acute panic attack” and “Approach to the agitated or violent patient.”

Rebreathing into a paper bag can cause significant hypoxemia and is therefore not recommended. [32]
Abnormal findings on physical exam (e.g., jugular venous distention, wheezing, crackles, altered mental status) suggest a diagnosis other than hyperventilation syndrome.

### Separation anxiety disorder

- Description: a disorder characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, or avoidance of separation from major attachment figures

- Separation anxiety disorder differs from nonpathological separation anxiety in its intensity and effect on the social and academic life of the individual.

- Separation anxiety is normal in children under a developmental age of 3 years. [37]

- Typically develops after a stressful life event, usually involving some form of loss (e.g., death of a relative, parental divorce, change of school)

- Onset: the condition can occur in, or persist into, adulthood and may have a debilitating effect on an individual's ability to work or socialize in the absence of attachment figures.

- Diagnostic criteria (DSM-V) [3]

- Fear of separation from major attachment figures, that is excessive for developmental level, involving at least 3 of the following features:

- Recurrent and excessive distress prior to, or during, separation

- Persistent worrying about the loss of attachment figures (e.g., due to illness, injury, or death)

- Persistent worrying about separation due to the individual being lost, kidnapped, injured, or ill

- Persistent reluctant to leave home due to fear of separation

- Avoidance of being left alone (e.g., at home or elsewhere)

- Avoidance of falling asleep, or sleeping away from home, without major attachment figure

- Persistent nightmares about separation

- Persistent somatic symptoms (e.g., headaches, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain)

- Duration: symptoms persist for at least 4 weeks in children/adolescents and 6 months in adults

- Significant impairment of academic, social, and/or work life (e.g., often a precursor to school refusal)

- Symptoms are not attributable to another psychiatric disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, psychosis, other anxiety disorders).

- Treatment of separation anxiety disorder [38]

- Psychotherapy

- All age groups: cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g., exposure therapy)

- Children: family therapy and parent-child interaction therapy

- Pharmacotherapy: SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) indicated as an adjunct to psychotherapy if there is moderate to severe functional impairment

- Complications

- Children: academic and social consequences of school refusal

- Adults: depression and panic disorder [37]

Children under 3 years of age commonly undergo periods of separation anxiety from attachment figures as a normal part of their development. The diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder should only be considered if the symptoms become excessive for developmental level. [37]

### Selective mutism

- Description: a psychiatric disorder characterized by the inability to speak in specific social situations (e.g., during class)

- Typically normal development of language and speech.

- Onset: generally before 5 years of age, although may not become clinically relevant until the child is required to perform verbally (e.g., with the start of school)

- Diagnostic criteria (DSM-V) [3]

- Consistent inability to speak in specific social settings where speaking is expected (e.g., does not speak in class but speaks at home)

- Interferes with academic or professional performance and social interaction

- Duration of symptoms: at least 1 month

- The inability to speak is not due to difficulties or discomfort with the spoken language expected in the social situation.

- The inability to speak is not attributable to schizophrenia spectrum disorder or another psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or a communication disorder.

- Treatment [39]
