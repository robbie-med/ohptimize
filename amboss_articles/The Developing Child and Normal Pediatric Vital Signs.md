# Physical examination

### Summary

The physical examination is typically the first diagnostic measure performed after taking the patient's history. It allows for an initial assessment of symptoms and is crucial for determining the differential diagnoses and further steps. Ideally, a complete physical examination should be performed for every patient. In practice, the physical examination is usually tailored to specific patient concerns. Sensitivity and specificity of physical examination findings vary widely. In some cases, a diagnosis is possible on the basis of the physical examination alone. This article covers the basics of the physical examination and links out to other articles for more specific examinations, including:

- Pediatric history taking and physical examination

- Gynecologic and obstetric history and physical examination

- Mental status examination

- Neurological examination

- Head and neck examination

- Lymph node examination

- Pulmonary examination

- Cardiovascular examination

- Abdominal examination

- Skin examination and nail examination

### Approach

### Objectives

- Determine a working diagnosis or differentials, and further diagnostic and management steps.

- Adjust approach from full to focused physical examination as needed based on medical history, patient condition, and findings.

### Preparing for the examination [1][2][3]

- Provide optimal conditions for the examination:

- Find a comfortable and quiet place.

- Ensure privacy: Ask other patients and possibly even family members (depending on patient preference and extent of exam) to leave the room.

- Disinfect hands prior to touching the patient.

- Introduce yourself and your title and explain the procedure.

- Always address patient by his/her name (ask first if it is unknown).

- During the examination, inform the patient about further steps.

- Examination tools include:

- Pens

- Stethoscope

- Penlight

- Tongue depressor

- Reflex hammer

- If necessary, otoscope and ophthalmoscope

Physician's toolkit

### Basic techniques

- Inspection

- Palpation

- Percussion

- Auscultation

- Functional examination

### Sequence

Approaches to the physical examination vary greatly and depend on a number of factors, including personal, specialty, and institutional preferences, as well as the reason for the visit or patient's chief concerns, condition, medical history, frequency of past visits, and time available. An example of a full exam sequence could consist of:

- Ask the patient to be seated:

- General appearance  and vital signs

- Some physicians begin with examination of the hands so that the patient becomes accustomed to the examiner's touch.

- Head and neck examination

- Neurological examination

- Pulmonary examination

- Possibly musculoskeletal examination (depending on patient concern)

- Ask the patient to lie supine:

- With upper body at a 30–45° angle

- Cardiovascular examination

- Peripheral portion of neurological examination (reflexes, muscle tone, peripheral sensation)

- Lying flat

- Abdominal examination

- Possibly musculoskeletal examination (depending on patient concern)

- Breast examination as indicated (inspection should have occurred while seated)

- Pelvic, prostate, or rectal exam as indicated

The physical examination should be tailored to the purpose of visit, patient history, and allotted time in a focused assessment by body systems.
