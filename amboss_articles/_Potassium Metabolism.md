Summary
Hypokalemia (low serum potassium) is a common electrolyte disorder that is typically caused by potassium loss (e.g., due to diarrhea, vomiting, or diuretic medication). Mild hypokalemia may be asymptomatic or cause mild nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, muscle weakness, and fatigue. Severe deficiency can cause cardiac arrhythmias and death. Treatment consists of oral or IV supplementation in conjunction with treatment of the underlying cause. In concurrent hypomagnesemia, which may lead to refractory hypokalemia, the simultaneous repletion of magnesium and potassium is necessary.

Definitions

    Hypokalemia: serum potassium (K+) level < 3.5 mEq/L [2]
    Severe hypokalemia: serum K+ level < 2.5 mEq/L [2]

Etiology
Hypokalemia is most often caused by renal or gastrointestinal potassium loss. Other electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypomagnesemia), alkalosis, and several medications can also have an impact on potassium homeostasis.

Pathophysiology

    Potassium is an important factor in maintaining the resting membrane potential.
    ↓ Extracellular K+ concentration → resting membrane potential becomes more negative than -90 mV → ↓ excitability [4]
    Alkalosis can impact potassium balance via intracellular shifts and vice versa. [5]
        Alkalosis → ↓ extracellular H+ → stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter (transfers H+ out of the cells in exchange for Na+) → ↑ intracellular Na+ → ↑ sodium gradient stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase (transfers K+ into the cells in exchange for Na+) → ↓ extracellular K+ concentration
        Hypokalemia → ↓ extracellular K+ concentration → ↓ potassium gradient inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase → ↓ extracellular Na+ → ↓ sodium gradient inhibits the Na+/H+ antiporter → ↓ extracellular H+ → alkalosis
        Exception: In renal tubular acidosis, findings include hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis!

K+ acts like H+: Hypokalemia leads to alkalosis and vice versa!
Particularly acute extracellular changes in concentration influence excitability! Chronic changes lead to intracellular compensation!

    Hypomagnesemia can impact potassium balance via the following mechanisms of increased renal loss: [6]
        Magnesium serves as a cofactor in Na+/K+-ATPases → hypomagnesemia disrupts the Na+/K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the proximal convoluted loop of Henle → ↓ Na+ reabsorption → ↑ luminal Na+ → ↑ Na+ reabsorption and ↑ K+ secretion by the principal cells distally
        Apical ROMK channels in principal cells are inhibited by intracellular magnesium. With low levels of magnesium available, the ROMK channels are not inhibited, resulting in increased K+ secretion.

Hypomagnesemia can lead to refractory hypokalemia!
Clinical features
Patients may be asymptomatic, particularly if the deficiency is mild. Symptoms usually occur if serum K+ levels are < 3.0 mEq/L and/or decrease rapidly. [3]

        Symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, irregular pulse, syncope)
        Hypotension
    Neuromuscular manifestations
        Muscle cramps and spasms [7]
        Muscle weakness, paralysis
        Respiratory failure secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles
        Rhabdomyolysis
        Decreased deep tendon reflexes
    Gastrointestinal manifestations
        Nausea, vomiting [7]
        Constipation or ileus
        Fatigue
    Other manifestations

Diagnosis
All patients require an ECG and laboratory studies to confirm the diagnosis and rule out concurrent electrolyte abnormalities. Further diagnostic tests depend on the suspected underlying etiology.
Initial evaluation
Laboratory studies [2]

    Electrolytes and kidney function
        BMP
            Low serum K+ levels
            Renal function tests
            Other electrolytes
        Serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate
    Blood gas (venous or arterial): may show metabolic alkalosis
    Urinary potassium: Consider measuring to narrow down underlying etiology. [11][12][13]
        Methods
            Spot urine: rapid assessment, indicated in urgent cases , less reliable than 24-hour collections
            24-hour urine collection: less practical, indicated for chronic cases and uncertain diagnoses, more accurate than spot urine
        Findings
            Renal loss: spot urine > 15–20 mEq/L (24-hour collection > 15 mEq/L) [2][12]
            Extrarenal loss: spot urine < 15–20 mEq/L (24-hour collection < 15 mEq/L) [13]

Consider confirming abnormal serum potassium levels with a repeat blood draw.
ECG findings in hypokalemia [3][14]

    Mild to moderate hypokalemia
        T-wave flattening or inversion
        ST depression
        Prolonged PR interval
    Moderate to severe hypokalemia
        Presence of U waves: small waveform following the T wave that is often absent but becomes more pronounced in hypokalemia or bradycardia [3]
        T and U wave fusion
        QT prolongation [14]
    Dysrhythmias
        Premature atrial and ventricular complexes
        Sinus bradycardia
        Paroxysmal atrial or junctional tachycardia
        Ventricular dysrhythmias, e.g., Torsades de pointes
        PEA/asystole

To remember that low potassium may result in a flattened T wave, think of: "No pot, no tea (T)!"
Identification of underlying etiology

    Review the patient's history and medication list to help identify potential causes of hypokalemia.
    If the etiology is still unclear, further testing can help determine the underlying etiology.
    Imaging is not routinely required but may be necessary if certain underlying etiologies are suspected. [2]

Treatment
Approach
Most patients require potassium chloride (KCl) repletion, management of concurrent electrolyte abnormalities (see “Electrolyte repletion”), and treatment of the underlying cause. See “Potassium replacement” for further details on repletion regimens for hypokalemia, treatment goals, warnings, and adverse effects.

    Severe hypokalemia (< 2.5 mEq/L) and/or high risk of recurrent severe hypokalemia
        KCl: IV repletion DOSAGE PLUS oral repletion if tolerated DOSAGE [16][17][18]
            Rate of repletion should not exceed 10–20 mEq/hour through a peripheral IV. > 10–20 mEq [16][18]
            Higher doses (up to 40 mEq/hour) must be administered through a central line.
            Order continuous cardiac monitoring for IV potassium infusions over 10 mEq/hour.
            Check potassium levels every 2–4 hours or after a maximum of 60 mEq (combined total from oral and IV sources) has been repleted.
        Consider admission to ICU, continuous cardiac monitoring, and central line placement.
    Moderate hypokalemia (2.5–2.9 mEq/L)
        KCl: Oral repletion DOSAGE is preferred unless the patient is unable to tolerate PO, has severe symptoms, or has ECG changes in hypokalemia. [17]
        Disposition is usually determined by treatment of the underlying disorder.
    Mild hypokalemia (3.0–3.4 mEq/L) with easily reversible cause
        Prioritize treatment of the underlying condition (e.g., GI fluid losses).
        Consider oral supplementation, e.g., KCl DOSAGE
        Consider increasing dietary potassium intake. [19]
        Patients can usually be discharged after stabilization.

[Management of hypokalemia] Management of hypokalemia
High concentrations of IV potassium can cause local venous irritation and potentially lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Limit the rate of infusion according to the type of IV access and place patients on a continuous cardiac monitor.
Correction of hypokalemia is a common cause of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients; monitor K+ levels frequently in patients receiving potassium repletion. [17][18]
In patients with hypokalemia, avoid solutions containing dextrose, which can increase insulin secretion and worsen hypokalemia. [16]
Treatment of the underlying condition in hypokalemia
See “Etiology of hypokalemia.”

    Review medications that may be affecting potassium balance, e.g., β2 agonists, laxatives.
    Diuretic-induced hypokalemia (e.g., loop diuretics or thiazides) [2]
        Discontinue the diuretic or reduce the dose and combine with potassium-sparing diuretics, e.g., spironolactone. DOSAGE
        Rehydrate with normal saline if the patient has both volume depletion and contraction alkalosis.
    Start oral or IV magnesium for patients with hypomagnesemia.
    Treat nausea and vomiting and provide fluid resuscitation for dehydration and hypovolemia.
    Consider aggressive potassium repletion for conditions at high risk of relapsing or refractory hypokalemia, e.g., DKA, high-dose insulin therapy, refeeding syndrome.
    Consider specialist consult (e.g., nephrology, endocrinology, dietician) as directed by the suspected underlying etiology.

Potassium supplementation will be ineffective if concurrent hypomagnesemia is left untreated (see “Magnesium repletion”).
Patients with a continued source of potassium loss (e.g., those on diuretics) may require long-term potassium supplementation. [16]

Summary
Hyperkalemia (high serum potassium) is a common and potentially life-threatening disorder of potassium balance. The most common cause is decreased kidney function. It can also be caused by acidosis, cell breakdown, endocrinological disturbances (e.g., hypoaldosteronism, hypocortisolism), and drugs such as potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and digoxin. Serum potassium (K+) is often falsely elevated due to the method of sampling and levels should be confirmed with repeat testing. To determine the underlying cause of hyperkalemia, it is essential to review the patient's medications, check kidney and endocrine function, and screen for cell lysis (e.g., hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis) and acid-base disorders. Acute increases in serum K+ are very dangerous, as they influence the resting membrane potential and thus the electrical excitability of cells. These changes can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. It is, therefore, essential to obtain an ECG to determine the level of cardiotoxicity. Management depends on the severity of the hyperkalemia and includes restriction of dietary K+, as well as medications to bind, shift, or eliminate K+, or to stabilize the cardiac membrane (e.g., calcium gluconate) if necessary. In refractory cases, dialysis may be required. Serum K+ should be monitored closely until it is corrected.

Etiology

    Potassium excess: due to altered K+ metabolism or intake
        Reduced excretion: acute and chronic kidney disease [3]
        Endocrine causes: hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism
        Drugs: potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, NSAIDs, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [4]

References:[4][6]
Pathophysiology

    Potassium is an important factor in maintaining the resting membrane potential
    ↑ Extracellular K+concentration → resting membrane potential becomes less negative than -90 mV → ↑ excitability

Particularly acute extracellular changes in concentration influence excitability! Chronic changes lead to intracellular compensation!
Clinical features
Symptoms usually occur if serum potassium levels are > 7.0 mEq/L or they change rapidly.

    Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation)
    Muscle weakness, paralysis, paresthesia
    ↓ Deep tendon reflexes
    Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Hyperkalemia (and hypokalemia) can cause cardiac arrhythmia and lead to ventricular fibrillation!References:[1][7][8][9]
Diagnosis
Approach [10]

    Obtain routine laboratory studies to:
        Confirm hyperkalemia and severity.
        Assess renal function.
        Evaluate etiology of hyperkalemia.
    Check ECG: Urgent treatment is required for ECG changes in hyperkalemia.
    Inquire about last renal replacement therapy for patients with ESRD (e.g., screen for missed hemodialysis appointments, adherence to peritoneal dialysis).
    Send further diagnostic laboratory testing depending on the suspected underlying etiology.

[Management of hyperkalemia] Management of hyperkalemia
Laboratory studies [11][12]

    BMP
        Glucose: If very high, consider spurious hyperkalemia secondary to hyperglycemic crisis.
        Serum electrolytes
            Na+: normal or can be ↓ in adrenal insufficiency (see “Diagnostics” in “Adrenal insufficiency”)
            K+: Repeat to confirm the diagnosis and rule out pseudohyperkalemia (see “Etiology”).
        Renal function tests: often show renal impairment [13]
    CBC: can show hemolytic anemia or thrombocytosis [14]
    Liver chemistries: may be abnormal in hemolysis or tumor lysis syndrome
    Blood gases (venous or arterial): often show metabolic acidosis [15]

An inverse relationship between serum K+ and pH (e.g., ↓ pH → ↑ K+) has previously been observed in specific types of metabolic acidosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and this association is inconsistent in clinical practice. [11][15]
ECG findings in hyperkalemia [16][17][18]
There is a weak correlation between serum K+ levels and the severity of ECG changes. Findings are more likely to occur with rapid-onset hyperkalemia.

    Mild hyperkalemia: 5.5–6.4 mEq/L
        Tall, peaked T waves 
    Moderate hyperkalemia: 6.5–8.0 mEq/L
        Lengthening of QRS interval (QRS complex widening)
        Widening and flattening of P wave, which eventually disappears
    Severe hyperkalemia: > 8.0 mEq/L
        Absent P wave
        Intraventricular conduction block
        Unusual QRS morphology
        Sine wave pattern: a sinusoidal pattern with absent P waves and a wide QRS complex that merges with the T wave; a marker of impending V-Fib and asystole
        Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., V-tach, V-fib), asystole

Investigation of underlying causes [19][20][21]
Depending on symptoms and risk factors, further testing may be appropriate, particularly if renal function is normal.

    Creatine kinase: ↑ in rhabdomyolysis
    LDH: ↑ in tumor lysis syndrome or hemolysis
    Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
        ↑ Aldosterone: suggestive of, e.g., pseudohypoaldosteronism or nephropathy due to sickle cell disease
        ↓ Aldosterone: Assess plasma renin activity or plasma renin concentration (see also “Hypoaldosteronism”).
            Normal or ↑ renin: suggests, e.g., hypoaldosteronism (e.g., due to Addison disease) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia
            ↓ Renin: suggests, e.g., AIN, diabetic nephropathy
    Cortisol: can be ↓ in primary adrenal insufficiency (see “Endocrine testing for adrenal insufficiency”)
    Urine electrolytes: rarely indicated [22]

Review the patient's medical history and medication list to help identify potential causes of hyperkalemia. [19]
Treatment
[Management of hyperkalemia] Management of hyperkalemia
Therapeutic approach to hyperkalemia [2][11][19][23]

    Determine severity: See “Risk stratification.”
    Hyperkalemic emergency: Patients require immediate management.
        Start continuous cardiac monitoring.
        If there are ECG changes: Stabilize the cardiac membrane first, e.g., with IV calcium gluconate.
        Initiate treatment to shift potassium intracellularly, e.g.:
            Short-acting insulin with glucose
            Consider the addition of inhaled SABAs.
        Consider nephrology and critical care consults.
        Admit to hospital for ongoing monitoring and treatment.
        Repeat serum K+ at minimum 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after treatment.
    All patients
        Identify and treat underlying causes.
        Review medications and discontinue or modify dosing of medications that may be contributing to hyperkalemia.
            Decrease dose (or consider discontinuation) of drugs required to treat underlying conditions, e.g., RAAS inhibitors.
            Avoid nonessential drugs associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., NSAIDs, over-the-counter supplements such as milkweed).
        Start a low potassium diet and avoid salt substitutes (consider nutrition consult). [12][24]
        Consider treatment to remove potassium from the body, e.g., cation-exchange resins, diuretics, hemodialysis.
        Repeat potassium regularly until it is within normal range, e.g., within 1–3 days. [25]

Urgent K+-lowering treatment may be necessary even in the absence of ECG changes.
To remember K+-lowering treatments, think C BIG K Die (if you see a big serum K+, your patient may die!): Calcium salts, Beta-agonists/Bicarbonate, Insulin + Glucose, Kation exchange medication, Dialysis/Diuretics.
The effects of calcium salts, insulin/glucose, and inhaled SABAs on serum K+ are temporary. Repeat doses may be required while waiting for interventions to remove K+ from the body to take effect.
Risk stratification [26]

    Hyperkalemic emergency is an acute severe elevation that requires urgent lowering and occurs if any of the following are present:
        Clinical manifestations: e.g., ECG changes in hyperkalemia, muscle weakness, paralysis
        Serum K+ > 6.0–6.5 mEq/L [27]
        Comorbidities that affect ongoing K+ influx and elimination: e.g., AKI, ESRD, GI bleeding, rhabdomyolysis, TLS
    Less urgent hyperkalemia (typically chronic elevations that can be lowered more slowly)
        Patient is asymptomatic
        Serum K+ is 5.5–6.0 mEq/L
        Patient has no high-risk comorbidities

Cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia can cause sudden death.
Cardiac membrane stabilization [23]
Calcium salts reduce cardiac irritability.

    Indication: ECG changes in hyperkalemia
    Options
        10% calcium gluconate DOSAGE [26]
        10% calcium chloride (preferably given in a central or deep vein) DOSAGE [19]
    Considerations [11]
        Ensure continuous cardiac monitoring throughout to detect potential arrhythmias.
        Effects last only 30–60 minutes; additional dosing may be required.

Calcium salts should result in normalization of the ECG appearance within 5 minutes; observe the cardiac monitor following initial treatment and repeat the dose if the ECG tracing still appears abnormal.
Calcium salts have no influence on serum K+ levels and therefore should be paired with a K+-lowering agent.
Intracellular potassium shifting [11][26][28]
These drugs should be given in tandem with calcium salts (if calcium is indicated).

    Insulin and glucose
        Preferred acute noninvasive K+-lowering treatment
        Sample agent: short-acting insulin combined with 50% dextrose DOSAGE
        Patients with glucose levels > 250 mg/dL should not receive D50W.
        Monitor all patients for hypoglycemia hourly for at least 2 hours after administration.
    Inhaled SABAs
        Consider as an adjunct to insulin (not effective as a monotherapy). [23][29]
        Sample agent: nebulized albuterol (off-label) DOSAGE
    Sodium bicarbonate
        Consider as an adjunct treatment only in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (i.e., pH < 7.2).
        There is no evidence to support using bicarbonate in the management of hyperkalemia in nonacidotic patients.
        Recommended concentration is IV 8.4% sodium bicarbonate DOSAGE [28]

Avoid administering calcium carbonate and sodium chloride through the same IV line without extensive flushing in between because of the risk of calcium precipitation. [30]
Enhanced potassium elimination [2][23][28]

    Not required for all patients; treatment of the underlying cause may be sufficient.
    The choice of treatment depends on underlying medical conditions and volume status.

Cation-exchange medications [26][31]

    Mechanism of action: These drugs release Na+ or Ca2+ ions in the gut, which are exchanged for K+, thereby enhancing enteral K+ elimination.
    Clinical applications: nonurgent lowering of K+ [11]
    Options
        Cation-exchange resins
            Sodium polystyrene sulfonate DOSAGE : falling out of favor due to adverse effects
            Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate DOSAGE
        Cation-exchange polymers, e.g., patiromer DOSAGE [32]
    Adverse effects
        Gastrointestinal upset
        Hypokalemia
    Considerations
        Avoid simultaneous administration with other oral medications, as resins may bind them, reducing absorption.
        Give with a laxative (avoid sorbitol). [33]

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate carries a risk of intestinal necrosis (especially if combined with the laxative sorbitol) and should be avoided in patients with abnormal bowel function. [33]
Hemodialysis

    Most effective definitive therapy for refractory hyperkalemia
    Preferred option in patients with end-stage renal failure (particularly if already receiving renal replacement therapy), or oliguria.
    For all other patients, avoided as a first-line option because of its invasive nature and adverse effects

Loop diuretics [28]

    Consider loop diuretics, e.g., furosemide DOSAGE for patients with volume overload
    Closely monitor fluid balance and electrolytes due to unpredictable effects and risk of adverse events.
