# Acute wounds

### Quick guide

### Diagnostic approach

Assess wound location, age, depth, width, and length.

Assess for contamination and signs of infection.

Obtain cultures from infected wounds.

Screen for life-threatening or limb-threatening complications (e.g., compartment syndrome).

Obtain labs and imaging as needed.

Assess for concurrent injuries (e.g., to tendon or bone).

Evaluate at-risk patients for nonaccidental trauma (e.g., intimate partner violence).

### Red flag features

If ≥ 1 of the following are present, consider antibiotic prophylaxis.

Complicated wounds (e.g., crush injuries, bite wounds)

Significant contamination (e.g., with feces, saliva, or dirt)

Implanted foreign bodies

Wounds in poorly vascularized areas (e.g., feet, hands)

Suspected extension to bones and joints (e.g., open fractures)

Wounds in areas with significant bacterial colonization (e.g., armpits, genitals)

Advanced age

Immunosuppression

Significant comorbidities (e.g., T2DM)

### Management checklist

Hemostatic measures for active bleeding

Perform wound irrigation and debridement for all open wounds.

Consider tetanus toxoid DOSAGE  ± tetanus immunoglobulin DOSAGE .

Primary closure for clean, recent open wounds

Secondary wound closure for contaminated, older open wounds

Immobilize joints with overlying wounds.

Consider antibiotic prophylaxis if red flag features are present.

Specialist consults for wounds as needed

In general, irrigate with 50–100 mL of tap water or saline per centimeter of wound length.

### Summary

Acute wounds are disruptions of the normal structure and function of skin and underlying soft tissue caused by trauma or chronic mechanical stress. Acute wounds may be open or closed. All wounds should be assessed for the extent of injury, degree of contamination, and injury to adjacent neurovascular structures and bones. Patients with multiple wounds should be screened for concurrent injuries to deeper structures or organs, as well as complications such as rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. Open wounds are managed with cleaning, removal of devitalized tissue, and, if feasible, wound closure. The type and timing of wound closure depend on the degree of contamination and how much time has passed since the injury. Options for wound closure range from glue, wound closure strips, and suturing to complex plastic surgery repairs such as skin grafting. Closed musculoskeletal wounds are managed according to the POLICE principle. Acute wounds typically proceed through an organized and predictable process of tissue repair. Wound complications include hematomas, seromas, infection, and delayed healing. Complications of abdominal surgical wounds additionally include wound dehiscence and evisceration, and fistulas of the GI tract.
Needlestick injuries, chronic wounds, and bite wounds are detailed in separate articles.

### Classification

### Types of acute wounds [1]

- Stab wounds

- Abrasions: superficial skin injuries caused by rubbing, scraping, and/or irritation

- Lacerations: skin compression and splitting with irregular and macerated edges

- Avulsion injury [2]

- Traumatic detachment of the skin and subcutaneous fat caused by a shearing force

- Can range from the detachment of small skin flaps to complete degloving of an extremity

- Bruises

- Rupture of blood vessels within the skin as a result of direct trauma, with the surface of the skin remaining intact

- Can also occur in muscles, bones, and internal organs

### Open vs. closed wounds [3]

- Open wound: a wound with skin breakage and exposure of underlying tissue to the outside environment

- Lacerations

- Gunshot wounds

- Punctures

- Closed wound: a wound with intact skin, and underlying tissue not directly exposed to the outside environment

- Contusions

- Hematomas

- Crush injuries

- Blunt trauma

### Initial management

This section covers the basics of wound management. See “Management of trauma patients,” “Blunt trauma,” and “Penetrating trauma” for further details.

### Approach [4][5][6]

- Identify severe and concealed injuries on the primary survey.

- Consider hemostatic measures for active bleeding.

- Screen for life-threatening or limb-threatening complications.

- Assess the wound for associated musculoskeletal or neurovascular injuries and degree of contamination.

- Consider additional diagnostics, specialty consults, and definitive management depending on the type of wound and associated injuries.

- See “Management of open wounds” and “Management of closed wounds.”

- Suspected open fracture or wound overlying a joint line

- Splint the affected joint or bone

- Begin general management of fractures and antibiotics for open fractures as needed.

- Evaluate at-risk patients for nonaccidental trauma (See “Sexual violence,” “Intimate partner violence,” “Older adult abuse,” and “Child abuse.”)

### Hemorrhage control

- Actively hemorrhaging wounds: Perform hemostatic measures.

- Mechanical hemostasis: local pressure over the wound, packing the wound, or application of a tourniquet proximal to the site of bleeding

- Pharmacological hemostasis: local hemostatic agents (e.g., epinephrine or fibrin) or systemic antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid)

- Surgical hemostasis: thermal coagulation (e.g., electrocautery) or ligation (e.g., sutures or hemostatic clips) of the bleeding vessel(s)

- Interventional radiology: angiographic embolization

- Hemorrhagic shock: Resuscitate with blood products. [7]

- Coagulopathy

- Obtain coagulation studies in patients with suspected or known coagulation disorders.

- Administer anticoagulant reversal in patients with ongoing or severe hemorrhage.

- In severe wound(s), consider withholding further doses of antithrombotics in consultation with specialists.

### Acute wound assessment

- Consider local or regional anesthesia or systemic analgesia before wound exploration (see “Pain Management” for drugs and dosages).

- Assess location, age, depth, width, length of the wound(s), and extent of devitalized tissue.

- Assess for degree of contamination (i.e., clean wounds or dirty wounds) and for signs of infection.

- Assess for concurrent injuries.

- Perform neurovascular examination prior to administering anesthesia to identify neurovascular injury.

- Assess for signs of fracture and joint injury.

- Assess for tendon injuries. (see “Finger tendon integrity testing,” “Biceps tendinopathy and biceps tendon rupture,” “Achilles tendon rupture,” and “Patellar tendon rupture” for details).

Penetrating wounds, open fractures, and wounds with extensive devitalized tissue are risk factors for tetanus.

### Diagnostics [4][8]

The diagnostic approach depends on the patient's hemodynamic status and the pretest probability of the suspected injury and associated complications.

- Identify and treat life- or limb-threatening complications (e.g., compartment syndrome, cardiac tamponade, crush syndrome).

- Truncal wounds and/or polytrauma: Obtain urgent diagnostics for trauma patients, e.g., coagulation panel, type and screen, eFAST, CT imaging for trauma, diagnostics for rhabdomyolysis.

- Extremity wounds

- Neurovascular injury: Consider CTA extremity, duplex US, EMG, or nerve conduction studies depending on the injury.

- Obtain X-rays if fractures, dislocations, or radiopaque foreign bodies are suspected.

- If indicated, measure compartment pressures.

- Infected wounds: Consider wound cultures.

- Consider screening for risk factors that impact wound healing (e.g., diabetes mellitus, anemia).

### Specialist consults for wounds

Consultation protocols vary among hospitals depending on the available specialist expertise and the agreements between specialties.

- General surgery for:

- Trauma (including polytrauma)

- Large or multiple wounds

- Blunt or penetrating abdominal injury

- Wounds potentially involving the anal sphincter (perineal injury)

- Orthopedic surgery for:

- Wounds overlying a fracture or dislocation

- Damage to underlying structures (such as vessels, nerves, tendons, or joint capsule)

- Plastic surgery for:

- Multiple or complex facial wounds (e.g., involving the lips or eyelids)

- Extensive injuries to the hands (may also be managed by orthopedics)

- Cardiothoracic surgery for blunt or penetrating chest injury

- Vascular surgery for suspected or confirmed vascular injury (transection, aneurysm, thrombosis)

- Neurosurgery for suspected TBI

- Urology and/or gynecology for genitourinary trauma

### Open wounds

### Approach

See “Initial management of acute wounds” for initial assessment and emergency measures.

- For all open wounds, perform wound irrigation and wound debridement of devitalized tissue. [9]

- Consider closure of acute open wounds depending on wound characteristics.

- Primary wound closure is indicated for recently sustained, clean, uninfected wounds that have edges that can be easily approximated.

- Consider secondary wound closure or tertiary wound closure for all other wounds (e.g., infected, contaminated, wide or irregular edges, delayed presentation).

- Identify if the wound should be repaired by a specialist (see “Specialist consults”).

- Consider referral to plastic surgery for skin grafting for wounds with extensive tissue loss.

- Consider antibiotics for acute open wounds depending on the wound and patient characteristics.

- Consider prophylaxis for wounds at high risk of infection including certain bite wounds.

- Treat infected wounds.

- Select antibiotics based on the likely pathogens  and local resistance patterns.

- Consider tetanus prophylaxis (tetanus toxoid DOSAGE  ± human tetanus immunoglobulin DOSAGE ).  [4][10]

When evaluating a wound for primary or secondary closure, consider the length of time that has elapsed since injury, wound characteristics, and comorbidities.
Refer patients with the following wounds for repair by a specialist: multiple, large, and/or complex wounds (e.g., facial wounds involving the eyelids, extensive hand injuries); wounds with damage to underlying structures (e.g., vessels, nerves, tendons); and wounds in the genitourinary tract.

### Wound irrigation
[11]

- Consider local anesthesia prior to irrigation in sensitive areas. [6]

- Wash the wound with soap and water.

- If there is risk of viral transmission (e.g., rabies, B-virus), rinse the wound with povidone-iodine or chlorhexadine.  [6][12][13]

- Irrigate wounds with pressurized tap water or saline.

- Avoid irrigation of open wounds with disinfectant solutions (e.g., peroxide) as these can impair wound healing. [6]

In general, irrigate with 50–100 mL of tap water or saline per centimeter of wound length. [6]
CollapseNotesFeedback
### Wound closure

See “Wound closure of bite wounds” for guidance specific to bite wounds.

### Primary wound closure

- Definition: closure of recent wounds by approximation of the wound edges, allowing for healing by primary intention

- Indications

- Recent, clean wounds that have a low risk of infection

- For details, see “Indications for primary wound closure.”

- Procedure: : See “Wound closure techniques.”

- Antibiotics [14]

- Minor, uncontaminated injuries: Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely required.

- Wounds at high risk of infection: Consider antibiotic prophylaxis.

- Wound healing

- Occurs by primary intention

- Wound healing occurs with minimal inflammation and minimal to no granulation tissue formation.

- Organ-specific tissue forms at the site of healing

- Minimal (hairline) scar formation

Acute wound managementWound management materialsSuturing techniquesTissue adhesiveHair apposition techniqueWound closure strips

### Secondary wound closure

- Definition: leaving a wound to heal by secondary intention (i.e., without approximating the wound edges)

- Indications

- Infected wounds, e.g., surgical site infection [15]

- Wounds at high risk of infection, e.g., wounds with implanted foreign bodies  [6]

- Bite wounds that do not meet the criteria for primary closure (see “Bite wounds” for details)

- Wounds older than the time frame within which primary closure can be safely performed.

- Large wounds with irregular edges that cannot be approximated without tension

- Goal: debridement to remove devitalized tissue; removal of contaminants and foreign bodies that may disrupt healing. [6]

- Procedure [6]

- Administer;  local, regional, or general anesthesia.

- Clean via pressured irrigation using warm, isotonic saline.  [6][16]

- Perform surgical (sharp) debridement: removal of devitalized tissue and debris to allow for wound healing

- Ensure drainage (e.g., silicone/rubber drains, strip of gauze) of deep wounds.

- Apply moist dressing.

- Immobilize the affected extremity, if necessary.

- Further treatment

- Wounds at high risk of infection: Consider antibiotic prophylaxis.

- Infected wounds: Administer antibiotics (see “Empiric antibiotic therapy for skin and soft tissue infections”).

- Regular dressing changes

- Reevaluation for delayed primary closure (if needed) after ∼ 3 days

- Consider negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as an adjunct to stimulate the healing process for large wounds.  [14][17]

- Wound healing

- Occurs by secondary intention

- Usually accompanied with pronounced inflammation

- Takes longer than wounds that have been repaired with primary closure

- Requires the formation of granulation tissue

- The wound bed is replaced with increased proliferation of fibroblasts.

- Pronounced scar formation

Open wound drainage system
Tetanus prophylaxis is usually required for most wounds that need secondary closure.

### Tertiary wound closure (delayed primary closure)

- Definition: surgical closure of a wound after healing by secondary intention has already begun; also known as healing by tertiary intention

- Indications

- Clean wounds with healthy edges in patients presenting after the time frame within which primary closure can be safely performed.

- Contaminated wounds left to heal by secondary intention and with no signs of infection after 3–5 days  [6]

- Procedure

- Clean the wound and perform debridement of any areas of devitalized tissue.

- Close the wound using an appropriate wound closure technique (e.g., simple interrupted sutures).

- Wound healing

- Occurs by tertiary intention

- Results in a larger scar than with primary or secondary closure due to an interruption in normal wound healing

Contaminated wounds can be closed (i.e., by delayed primary closure) if there are no signs of infection after a few days of observation.

### Wound dressing
[18][19][20][21]
The following general principles apply to acute wound dressings. For acute wounds with delayed healing, see "Chronic wound dressing."

- Very superficial wounds may not require a dressing.

- If a dressing is required, select one based on wound characteristics, e.g.:

- Superficial wounds (e.g., superficial burns or abrasions)

- Dry or low exudate: films, hydrogels, impregnated gauze

- Low to moderate exudate: hydrocolloids

- Wounds with high exudate: absorbent dressing (e.g., alginate dressing, foam dressing)

- Deep wounds with active bleeding: hemostatic gauze packings

- Wounds that require delayed closure: moist dressings (e.g., hydrogel dressing) [6]

- Avoid adherent dressings (e.g., gauze) as they can damage the wound bed.

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Antibiotics

### Wounds at high risk of infection [4][6][22]

If one or more of the following high-risk features are present, antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered.

- Wound characteristics

- Complicated wounds, e.g., crush injuries, deep puncture wounds

- Significant contamination, e.g., with feces, saliva, or dirt

- Implanted foreign bodies

- Wound location

- Poorly vascularized areas, e.g., feet, hands

- Suspected extension to bones and joints, e.g., open fractures

- Areas with significant bacterial colonization, e.g., armpits, genitals, intraoral wounds  [23]

- Patient characteristics

- Advanced age

- Immunosuppression

- Significant comorbidities, e.g., diabetes mellitus

### Antibiotic prophylaxis [24]

- A single dose is usually sufficient for superficial wounds, while deep wounds and open fractures may require longer regimens.

- Specific regimes depend on the type and location of the wound, e.g:

- Bite wounds: See “Antibiotics for bite wounds.”

- Gaping intraoral lacerations: Antibiotics should cover oral flora, topical antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin) may be considered. [4][23]

- Puncture wounds of the foot: Consider adding agents that cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or MRSA. [4]

Most wounds that can undergo primary closure do not require antibiotic prophylaxis, except wounds at high risk of infection.

### Infected wounds [24]

- Obtain diagnostics for infection based on clinical evaluation. [25][26]

- Indications

- Signs of spreading wound infection

- Failure to improve with antimicrobial treatment

- Specimen: punch biopsy (preferred) or superficial swab using the Levine technique

- Method: molecular analysis (preferred, if available) or wound culture

- See "Management of infected wounds."

- Specific antibiotic regimes may be necessary for certain types of wounds, including:

- Infected marine wounds  [4][10]

- Superficial infections (e.g., erysipelas): Consider penicillins or macrolides.

- Purulent infections (e.g., abscess): Consider penicillinase-resistant penicillins or 1st generation cephalosporins

- Necrotizing infections, patients with chronic wounds or immunocompromise: broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against anaerobes, gram-positive aerobes, and gram-negative bacteria

- Infected bite wounds: See “Antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy for bite wounds.”

### Follow-up

- Arrange regular follow-up to assess wound healing, especially of complicated wounds.

- Ensure regular dressing changes.

- Educate patients on wound care.

- Keep the wound clean and dry.

- Check regularly for signs of wound infection.

- Seek medical attention if the wound deteriorates.

- Schedule suture/staple removal as needed; always assess wound healing before removing sutures/staples. [4]

- In otherwise healthy individuals, the timing of suture/staple removal depends on the location of the wound.

- Face: after 3–5 days

- Scalp and trunk: after 7–10 days

- Extremities: after 10–14 days

- Timing of suture/staple removal may be longer for complex wounds or if there are risk factors for delayed wound healing.

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Closed wounds

- See “Initial management of acute wounds” for initial assessment, emergency measures, and diagnostics.

- Ensure proper analgesia (see “Pain management” for drugs and dosages).

- Treat concomitant injuries.

- Screen for and manage complications (e.g., compartment syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis) [8][27]

- Minimize further inflammation: POLICE principle for acute musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., injuries to bones, tendons, or ligaments)  [28]

- Protection

- Optimal Loading

- Ice

- Compression

- Elevation

### Plastic and reconstructive surgery

### Skin grafting [29]

Skin grafts may be used to close wounds, prevent fluid and electrolyte loss, and reduce bacterial burden and infection.

## Full thickness skin graft (FTSG)

- Graft: epidermis and dermis (including dermal appendages), usually obtained from areas of redundant and pliable skin (e.g., groin, lateral thigh, lower abdomen, lateral chest)

- Indications: small, uncontaminated, well-vascularized wounds

- Advantages: good postoperative cosmetic outcome

- Disadvantages: high risk of necrosis, secondary injury to the donor area

## Split-thickness skin graft (STSG)

- Graft: epidermis and upper part (¼–¾) of the dermis (without dermal appendages)

- Indications: many uses; resurface large wounds and mucosal deficits, line cavities, close donor sites of flaps, treat large chronic wounds

- Advantages: heals well, only superficial secondary defect in donor area, which does not have to be covered

- Disadvantages: scar formation when graft heals, skin pigmentation change, tendency to contract, more fragile

- Subtype: mesh graft

- Graft can be stretched 3–6 times its original size by grid‑like incisions.

- Suitable for large skin defects

Skin grafts are contraindicated in the case of contaminated wounds or insufficient blood supply.
Mesh graftExcized venous ulcer with a split-thickness skin graft using mesh graftingReversed cross finger flap

### Composite graft [30]

- Graft: a graft containing multiple structures, such as skin and other structures like muscles, bones, or cartilage

- Indications: distal fingertip amputations, nasal reconstructions, ear reconstructions

- Advantages: heals well, usually includes pedicle containing blood supply, aesthetically pleasing

- Disadvantages: higher infection rate, increased risk that graft does not take compared to local flaps

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Special wounds

### Amputations [31][32][33][34]

An amputation is the surgical or traumatic severance of a body part.

## Types

- Complete amputation: the body part is totally severed

- Partial amputation: some soft tissue remains connected to the affected body part and to the rest of the body

- Surgical amputation: the surgical removal of a body part

- Indications

- Gangrene (e.g., due to diabetes mellitus, bacterial infection such as Clostridium perfringens, or peripheral arterial disease)

- Infection (e.g., osteomyelitis)

- Malignancy (e.g., osteosarcoma)

- Irreparable trauma injury (e.g., comminuted fracture of a limb)

- Severely burned limbs

- Compartment syndrome

- Severe contractures

- Congenital anomalies

- Severe thermal and/or electrical injury

- Procedure

- Preparation and disinfection of the limb

- Preparation of skin flaps (for closing the wound)

- Dissection of the fascia, muscles, vessels, and nerves

- Transsection of the bone (if necessary)

- Smoothing of the edges of the bone

- Fixation of the remaining muscles along the bone

- Suturing and closing of the fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and the skin (see “Acute wound treatment”)

- Traumatic amputations: Most traumatic amputations are unintentional, resulting from factory, farm, or power tool injuries.

- Fingers: See “Finger amputations.”

Do not allow the amputated part to be in direct contact with ice, because this can cause further damage.

## Complications

- Wound infection: stump pain, erythema, fever, and wound drainage

- Deep vein thrombosis

- Stump hematoma

- Stump ulcer

- Etiology: most commonly due to friction and repetitive pressure from a prosthesis with a suboptimal fit

- Risk factors: conditions associated with poor wound healing (e.g., diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, vasoconstriction)

- Management of noninfected stump ulcer: pressure relief, skin care, frequent wound checks, and maintaining an optimal fit between prosthetic socket and residual limb

- Edema

- Contractures leading to deformities and diminished function in the joint adjacent to the stump

- Skin necrosis around the vital stump

- Phantom limb pain: the sensation of a lost limb after amputation, which often feels painful

- Phantom limb sensation: the sensation that an amputated or lost limb is still intact, often involving pain (phantom limb pain)

- Residual limb pain: stump pain following an amputation

### Bite wounds

See “Bite wound management” in “Animal bites” for details.

- Infection risk and transmitted organisms depend on the animal (e.g., human bites, dog bites, cat bites).

- Perform thorough wound irrigation and debridement for all patients.

- Provide tetanus prophylaxis for all patients with outdated or unknown tetanus immunization.

- Wound closure strategy, rabies postexposure prophylaxis, indications for antibiotics for bite wounds, and depend on animal and wound characteristics (see “Overview of bite wound management”).

- Manage envenomation, if present.

### Stab wounds

- When performing first aid, do not remove the foreign body from the wound, as this could stop the object's sealing and tamponading effect, which could result in bleeding.

- Removal in a hospital setting with staff prepared for immediate surgical intervention

- Treatment: see “Penetrating trauma”

Stab wound in the left paraumbilical region

### Miscellaneous

- Needlestick injuries

- Decubitus ulcers
