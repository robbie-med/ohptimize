# Teratogenesis

### Summary

Teratogenesis plays an important role in neonatology and is a common cause of intellectual disability. Teratogens are environmental factors that result in permanent structural or functional malformations or death of the embryo or fetus. Many congenital malformations are of unknown origin, but known teratogens include drugs, maternal illnesses and infections, metal toxicity, and physical agents (e.g., radiation). The fetus is most susceptible in the 3rd–8th weeks of pregnancy during organogenesis in the embryonic period; after 8 weeks, growth and function are affected. The earlier the exposure to the teratogenic agent in utero, the more severe the defects are in the embryo/fetus. However, the individual response to teratogens is highly varied and depends on genetic susceptibility and severity of the exposure.
See “Pharmacotherapy during pregnancy” for more information on teratogenic drugs during pregnancy.
See “Congenital TORCH infections” for more information on teratogenic infectious agents.

### Overview

- Teratogen: an environmental factor that causes a permanent structural or functional abnormality, growth restriction, or death of the embryo or fetus

- Effects depend on multiple factors

- The pharmacological properties, dose, and regimen of drug exposure determine the risk of developing teratogenic birth defects.

- Stage of pregnancy in which exposure occurs

| Overview of mechanisms of teratogenesis |
| --- |
| Phase | Stage in pregnancy | Significance |
| Preimplantation phase | 0–15 days after fertilization: early embryonic period | Toxicity to the developing embryo can cause spontaneous abortion (all-or-nothing effect). |
| Embryonic phase | First trimester | Corresponds to the period of organogenesis  Most significant period for teratogenic birth defects |
| Phase of fetal growth and maturation | Second and third trimesters | Period of fetal growth and maturation Can lead to deficits in organ function, intellect, behavior, or minor structural malformations |

- The physical effects of teratogens are widely varied (see individual conditions for specific manifestations).

- VACTERL association [1]

- Vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal, and limb abnormalities

- Due to a defect during the development of embryonic mesoderm

- Limb deformities

- Syndactyly: fusion of two or more fingers or toes (most common congenital malformation of the limbs)

- Polymelia/polydactyly: supernumerary limbs, fingers, or toes

- Oligodactyly, adactyly: absence of one or more of the fingers or toes

- Ectromelia: collective term for hypoplasia and/or aplasia of one or more long bones, resulting in limb deformity

- Peromelia/perodactyly: amputation-like stump of a limb, finger, or toe

### Alcohol: fetal alcohol syndrome (embryo-fetal alcohol syndrome) [7]

## Epidemiology

- Most common cause of teratogenic damage in children (0.2–1.5 per 1,000 live births) [8]

- Most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the US

## Mechanism of teratogenesis

- Failed neuronal and glial cell migration

## Clinical findings

- Smooth hypoplastic philtrum

- Down-slanting, short palpebral fissures

- Hypertelorism

- Microcephaly

- Epicanthal folds

- Receding chin

- Features of specific systemic defects

- Heart defects (mainly ventricular septal defect)

- Heart-lung fistulas

- Skeletal anomalies (limb dislocations, joint contractures, pectus excavatum/pectus carinatum)

- Holoprosencephaly: a developmental field defect in which the forebrain fails to divide into two hemispheres, resulting in fusion of ventricles (leading to the formation of monoventricle) and other bilateral cerebral structures, e.g., basal ganglia  ;  [10]

- Most commonly occurs during the 3rd–4th week of pregnancy [11]

- Potential genetic causes include:

- Mutations in SHH gene coding for sonic hedgehog protein

- Trisomy 13

- Associated clinical features

- Craniofacial abnormalities (cyclopia, cleft lip/palate, hypotelorism, and/or proboscis)

- Endocrine disorders related to pituitary dysfunction (e.g., diabetes insipidus)

### Risk of tobacco product use during pregnancy [12][13]

- Mechanism of teratogenesis

- Nicotine: ↑ catecholamine release → vasoconstriction of uteroplacental blood vessels → compromised blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus

- Carbon monoxide: ↑ COHb causes tissue hypoxia

- Effects

- Intrauterine growth restriction

- Low birth weight

- Increased risk of preterm labor and miscarriage (e.g., due to placental abnormalities such as placental abruption)
