### Summary

Jaundice, or icterus, is a yellowish discoloration of tissue caused by the accumulation of bilirubin deposits. Bilirubin deposition most commonly occurs in the skin and the sclerae and becomes apparent when bilirubin levels reach > 2 mg/dL. Jaundice can be divided into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic etiologies. Prehepatic jaundice is caused by the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, which is due to either increased hemoglobin breakdown or impaired hepatic uptake. Intrahepatic jaundice may be caused by intrahepatic cholestasis, impaired bilirubin conjugation, or impaired excretion of bilirubin by the liver. Posthepatic jaundice is caused by the accumulation of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia usually due to extrahepatic cholestasis from biliary obstruction. In jaundice that arises from cholestasis, patients may present with pruritus, dark urine, and pale stools. Diagnosis is based on laboratory studies (e.g., liver function tests) and, in most cases, a transabdominal right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound. The treatment of jaundice is determined by the underlying disease process and can often be complemented with symptomatic treatment (e.g., for pruritus) or ursodeoxycholic acid.

### Definitions

- Jaundice: yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes due to the deposition of bilirubin

- Cholestasis: impaired production, secretion, or outflow of bile

- Hyperbilirubinemia: an increased serum concentration of bilirubin (See “Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia” and “Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia” for details.)

### Etiology

Adult jaundice can be divided into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic etiologies.  See “Overview of mechanisms of neonatal jaundice” for etiologies of jaundice and kernicterus in neonates, e.g., hemolytic disease of the newborn, congenital hypothyroidism, biliary atresia.
The most common causes of adult hyperbilirubinemia can be remembered with the mnemonic “HOT Liver”: Hemolysis, Obstruction, Tumor, and Liver disease.

### Pathophysiology

- Jaundice is due to an elevated level of serum bilirubin, which may be caused by prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic defects.

- Serum bilirubin concentration depends on the rate of formation and hepatobiliary elimination of bilirubin.

- Any pathology that impairs the process could increase serum bilirubin level: See “Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia” and “Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia” for details.  [6]

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Clinical features

- Jaundice

- Scleral icterus (yellow discoloration of the sclerae) develops at serum bilirubin levels > 2–3 mg/dL.

- Skin discoloration becomes apparent at serum bilirubin levels > 4–5 mg/dL.

- Accompanying features: vary depending on the underlying etiology

- Features associated with cholestasis [7]

- Pale, clay-colored (acholic) stool

- Darkening of urine

- Pruritus  [8]

- Fat malabsorption (steatorrhea, weight loss)

- RUQ abdominal pain

- Chronic biliary obstruction leading to backflow of bile may result in inflammation and hepatomegaly. [6]

- Features associated with hemolysis: pallor, fatigue, exertional dyspnea (see “Clinical features of hemolytic anemia”)

- Features associated with acute liver failure: anorexia, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain (see “Clinical features of acute liver failure”)

Cholestasis may be seen in the absence of jaundice, particularly during the early stages of cholestasis. Depending on the clinical scenario, jaundice and cholestasis may occur separately or concurrently.

### Diagnosis

### Approach    [1]

- All patients

- Perform a detailed clinical evaluation (including medication history) to identify features of cholestasis, hemolysis, or liver disease.

- Assess for hepatomegaly and identify RUQ pain.

- Obtain liver chemistries (including total, direct and indirect bilirubin) along with other routine laboratory studies (e.g., CBC, BMP, urinalysis).

- Predominant elevation of indirect bilirubin: See “Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia” for details.

- Obtain a hemolysis workup

- Consider specialized testing for hereditary conditions in select cases

- Predominant elevation of direct bilirubin: See “Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia” for details.

- Distinguish between hepatocellular injury and cholestasis.

- Obtain additional laboratory studies and imaging based on the suspected etiology, e.g., RUQ ultrasound for cholestasis.

- Cholestasis

- Dilated bile ducts

- Cause of obstruction, e.g., stones , masses

Double duct sign

### Diagnostic procedures [10][11]

Depending on clinical suspicion, and in consultation with a specialist, additional diagnostic procedures may be necessary, including:

- ERCP

- Endoscopic ultrasound

- Percutaneous liver biopsy

### Differential diagnoses

- See “Etiology” for a list of underlying causes of adult jaundice.

- Pseudojaundice [14]

- Carotenoderma

- Deposition of carotene in the skin can also cause yellow-orange discoloration of the skin.

- Due to excessive consumption of multivitamin supplements or foods that are rich in beta carotene (e.g., carrots, sweet potatoes, kale, oranges)

- Addison disease: hyperpigmentation of the skin caused by increased melanin synthesis

In contrast to jaundice, pseudojaundice does not result in scleral icterus.
The differential diagnoses listed here are not exhaustive.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

### Background

- Definition: elevated total bilirubin with < 15% direct bilirubin (normal serum total bilirubin: 0.1–1.0 mg/dL)

- Pathophysiology

- Prehepatic

- ↑ Hemoglobin breakdown

- ↓ Hepatic uptake of bilirubin

- Intrahepatic: ↓ Conjugation of bilirubin

Gilbert syndrome is a cause of intrahepatic jaundice that causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

### Diagnostics

- Perform hemolysis workup

- Laboratory studies suggestive of hemolysis present: Manage according to the underlying cause and consult hematology.

- Normal results in hemolysis workup: Consider specialized testing for hereditary hyperbilirubinemia, e.g., Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome. [15]

- See also “Diagnostics for hemolytic anemia.”

Common laboratory findings for hemolysis: ↑ indirect bilirubin, ↑ LDH, and ↓ haptoglobin

### Management

Identify and treat the underlying cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Conditions associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can manifest with varying degrees of jaundice and abnormally elevated indirect bilirubin. Those that cause prehepatic jaundice can have low elevations (< 15%) of direct bilirubin. Most conditions that cause intrahepatic jaundice (with the exception of Gilbert syndrome) can also have some degree of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but typically exhibit significantly elevated direct bilirubin (see “Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia”).

|  | Distinguishing clinical features | Distinguishing diagnostic findings | Management |
| Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [16] | Pallor, fatigue, exertional dyspnea Splenomegaly | ↓ Hb, ↓ Hct, and ↓ RBC count ↓ Haptoglobin ↑ LDH Positive Coombs test | May include: Corticosteroids Splenectomy |
| Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [17] | Pallor, fatigue Petechiae | Schistocytes on blood smear ↓ Hb, ↓ Hct, and ↓ RBC count ↓ Haptoglobin ↑ Reticulocytes ↑ LDH | Supportive treatment Pharmacotherapy, depending on etiology See “Hemolytic uremic syndrome.” See “Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.” |
| Hemolytic transfusion reaction [18] | Fever Dyspnea, tachypnea | ↓ Hb, ↓ Hct, and ↓ RBC count ↓ Haptoglobin ↑ LDH | Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction: usually self-limited Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction Discontinue transfusion and stabilize the patient. Consult critical care. |
| Gilbert syndrome [19] | Jaundice is intermittent and mild | Slightly ↑ indirect bilirubin but < 3 mg/dL Otherwise normal liver function No evidence of hemolysis Detection of mutation using PCR (not routinely performed) | Treatment typically not required |

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

### Background

- Definition: elevated direct bilirubin (normal serum direct bilirubin: ≤ 0.3 mg/dL)  [20]

- Pathogenesis: associated with intrahepatic and/or posthepatic conditions

- ↓ Drainage of bilirubin via biliary tract

- ↑ Reuptake of bilirubin

### Diagnostics

Determine whether the liver chemistries suggest a hepatocellular or cholestatic etiology. Consult gastroenterology for further guidance if the cause is unclear.

- AST and ALT elevated out of proportion to ALP: suggestive of hepatocellular injury

- Obtain laboratory studies according to clinical suspicion; usually includes:

- Viral serologies: acute viral hepatitis panel, EBV, CMV

- Serum ceruloplasmin

- Autoimmune antibodies: antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody

- Obtain a transabdominal RUQ ultrasound. [11]

- ALP elevated out of proportion to AST and ALT: suggestive of cholestasis  [21]

- Obtain a transabdominal RUQ ultrasound to differentiate between intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis.

- Consider advanced diagnostics, e.g., CT, MRCP, or ERCP, depending on ultrasound findings.

- Isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: Consider testing for inherited hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome) in consultation with a specialist. [15]

Common laboratory findings for cholestasis: ↑ alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ↑ gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and ↑ direct bilirubin

### Hepatocellular injury

Provide supportive care and identify and treat the underlying condition in all patients. See also “Acute liver failure.”
Elevated hepatocellular enzymes (e.g., AST, ALT) and varying degrees of jaundice are commonly seen in conditions that cause hyperbilirubinemia due to hepatocellular injury. Although elevations of both direct and indirect bilirubin are possible, a predominantly high direct bilirubin is most common, leading to mostly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

|  | Distinguishing clinical features | Distinguishing diagnostic findings | Management |
| Hepatitis A [1] | Fever Fatigue Nausea, vomiting RUQ pain | ↑ Anti-HAV IgM antibodies | Provide supportive care. See “Treatment” in “Hepatitis A” for details. |
| Cirrhosis [1] | Fatigue Nausea, vomiting Hepatosplenomegaly Ascites Peripheral edema | ↓ Total protein (↓ albumin) ↓ Platelets ↑ INR ↑ Ammonia RUQ ultrasound: nodular liver surface | Identify and treat the underlying etiology. Provide supportive care. Optimize fluid status. Prevent complications. See “Treatment of cirrhosis” for details. |
| Alcohol-associated hepatitis [22][23][24] | Heavy and/or active alcohol use RUQ pain Hepatomegaly Ascites Other features of alcohol-associated liver disease, alcohol withdrawal, SIRS, constitutional symptoms, or malnutrition | AST:ALT > 1.5 ↓ Total protein (↓ albumin) ↑ INR RUQ ultrasound: hepatomegaly and increased echogenicity | Alcohol cessation  Nutritional support Consider steroids and liver transplant |
| Late-stage severe acetaminophen toxicity [25] | History of acetaminophen overdose  Nausea, vomiting RUQ pain Hepatomegaly Hepatic encephalopathy | Persistently detectable acetaminophen level Variable changes in liver chemistries and coagulation panel depending on the time of ingestion | N-acetylcysteine Liver transplant referral See “Management of acute liver failure.” |
| Wilson disease [1][26] | Dystonia, dysarthria Parkinsonism, tremor Hepatosplenomegaly Kayser-Fleischer rings | ↓ Serum ceruloplasmin ↑ Urine copper excretion (over 24 hours) | Chelating agents Low-copper diet See “Treatment” in “Wilson disease.” |

An AST:ALT ratio > 1.5 suggests alcohol-associated hepatitis.

### Cholestasis

## Definitions

- Cholestasis: impaired production, secretion, or outflow of bile

- Nonobstructive intrahepatic cholestasis: impaired bile formation or secretion

- Obstructive intrahepatic cholestasis: biliary obstruction within the liver

- Obstructive extrahepatic or posthepatic cholestasis: obstruction of the biliary ducts between the liver and the duodenum

## Management

- Identify and treat the underlying cholestatic causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

- Consider invasive intervention (e.g., cholecystectomy, ERCP) for select patients with symptomatic gallstones, biliary strictures, or other obstructing masses.

- Management of cholestasis-associated pruritus [8][27][28]

- Mild: emollient solutions for skin hydration

- Moderate to severe

- Cholestyramine (first-line) DOSAGE

- Rifampin (off-label) DOSAGE  [27][28]

- Opioid antagonists: e.g., naltrexone (off-label) DOSAGE  [27][28]

Varying degrees of jaundice and elevations of cholestatic enzymes (including ALP, GGT, and direct bilirubin) are seen in conditions that cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to cholestasis.
