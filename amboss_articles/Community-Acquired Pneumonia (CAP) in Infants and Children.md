# Pneumonia in children

### Summary

Pneumonia, a common infection in children, is a respiratory illness characterized by inflammation of the alveolar space and/or the interstitial tissue of the lungs. The etiology is typically bacterial or viral, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common pathogen overall, particularly in those < 2 years old. As with adults, pneumonia in children can be categorized as typical or atypical, according to clinical features. For typical pneumonia, the presentation may be similar to those in adults (including productive cough, tachypnea, fever, and lethargy), with possible additional features such as abdominal pain, difficulty feeding, and grunting. In atypical pneumonia, children may present with a mild, slowly-progressing course that includes malaise, low-grade fever, and widespread wheeze. Management depends on severity and etiology. The first step is to determine whether patients meet the admission criteria for pediatric CAP. All patients require a respiratory viral panel to help guide treatment; for children who meet admission criteria, additional diagnostic tests include imaging and blood studies. Empirical treatment consists of supportive measures (e.g., respiratory support, antipyretics), antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection, and antivirals when available (e.g., for influenza, COVID-19).
Neonatal bacterial pneumonia is detailed separately.

### Management

### Approach

- Perform an ABCDE assessment; initiate immediate stabilization measures when required.

- Screen for admission criteria for pediatric CAP.

- Order diagnostic studies as indicated.

- All children: respiratory viral panel

- Children requiring admission: blood studies and imaging

- Initiate recommended management (inpatient or outpatient).

- Provide supportive therapy for pneumonia (e.g., respiratory support, antipyretics) as needed.

### Immediate stabilization

- Consult PICU.

- Start respiratory support.

- Hypoxemia: Start supplemental oxygen.

- Respiratory failure or signs of impending respiratory failure: Start mechanical ventilation.

- Hemodynamically unstable patients: Initiate management of septic shock.

### Admission criteria for pediatric CAP [7]

- Hypoxemia (< 90%)

- Signs of respiratory distress

- Suspected bacterial CAP in infants < 6 months of age

- Suspected pathogen with increased virulence (e.g., MRSA)

- In caregivers, risk factors for poor adherence or barriers to follow up

- Underlying conditions/comorbidities that may affect illness severity

Validated criteria for determining severity and/or need for admission in pediatric pneumonia (equivalent to CURB-65 in adults) have not been successfully developed. [7][8][9]

### Diagnostics for pediatric CAP

All patients require a respiratory viral panel. Further studies are usually reserved for patients with refractory disease or those who require hospitalization.

## Laboratory studies

- Respiratory viral panel

- Helps determine if antibiotics or targeted antiviral therapy is appropriate.

- For findings see “Etiology of pediatric CAP.”

- Blood tests

- CBC  [10]

- CRP/ESR  [1]

- Procalcitonin  [1]

- Blood cultures

- Sputum samples are not routinely performed because of:

- Difficulties obtaining a sample in younger children

- Poor yield

## Imaging[7]

- CXR for pediatric pneumonia

- Views: (AP and lateral)

- Indications include hypoxemia, signs of respiratory distress, or refractory disease

- Stable, well-appearing, immunocompetent children ≥ 3 months of age seen in ambulatory settings do not require CXR to confirm the diagnosis. [7][11]

- Findings: See “X-ray findings in pneumonia.”

- Lung POCUS

- Indications

- Can be used as an alternative to CXR

- Suspected parapneumonic effusions, empyema

- Findings: See “Lung ultrasound in pneumonia.”

Bilateral hyperinflation and right lung consolidation

## Additional studies

- Bronchoscopy;  and thoracentesis are among the additional studies that may be performed in severe or complicated disease.

- For further information, see “Advanced diagnostics for pneumonia.”

### Inpatient management [1][7]

- Start supportive therapy for pneumonia including respiratory support.

- Consider infectious disease/pulmonology/PICU consults as appropriate.

- Start pathogen-directed management.

- See “Management of bacterial pneumonia in children.”

- See “Management of viral pneumonia in children.”

- Tailor treatment to culture results when available.

- Regularly reassess patients for complications of pediatric CAP; treat if present.

- Consider discharge when the following criteria are met: [7]

- Clinical improvement for at least 12 hours

- Stable pediatric vital signs

- Able to tolerate oral medication

- Caregivers are able to give medication and there are no barriers to follow-up.

### Outpatient management [1][7]

- Initiate supportive therapy for pneumonia.

- Start pathogen-directed management.

- See “Management of bacterial pneumonia in children.”

- See “Management of viral pneumonia in children.”

- Educate caregivers on return precautions and arrange for a follow-up in 48–72 hours.

- At follow-up: [7]

- Clinical improvement: Continue treatment.

- No improvement

- Assess for complications (see “Diagnostics for pediatric CAP”).

- Reevaluate for admission criteria for pediatric CAP.

- Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy is typically given for a maximum of 7 days. [1]

For pre-school-aged children (2–5 years old), antibiotics are not routinely recommended, as viruses are the most common cause.

### Management of bacterial pneumonia in children

### Overview [1][7]

- Start empiric antibiotics for all patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia.

- Patients requiring hospitalization: usually intravenous antibiotic therapy

- Outpatients: oral antibiotic therapy

- If features of atypical pediatric pneumonia are present, cover for atypical pathogens.

- Symptoms of pediatric sepsis: Initiate treatment of pediatric sepsis.

- Provide supportive treatment for pneumonia.

- Tailor treatment to culture results if possible.

- Switch patients on IV antibiotics to oral therapy when: [1]

- Symptoms improve.

- Patients can tolerate oral intake.

- Regularly reassess patients, and escalate care as needed.

If typical and atypical CAP cannot be distinguished from each other, combine a beta-lactam and a macrolide for empiric therapy. [7]

### Management of viral pneumonia in children

Viral pneumonia is the most common cause of CAP in children < 5 years of age.

### Overview

- Provide supportive therapy for pneumonia.

- Offer antiviral therapy when indicated.

- Regularly reassess (until recovered) for the development of bacterial superinfection.  [7]

### Management of influenza pneumonia in children

- Specific antiviral therapy for influenza is available and licensed for pediatric use.

- Start antivirals in children with:

- Suspected or confirmed influenza infection in children < 5 years [13]

- Moderate-to-severe CAP likely due to influenza

- For further information, see “Treatment of influenza.”

Start antivirals immediately in patients with moderate-to-severe CAP and suspected influenza, even before confirming influenza infection. [7]

### Management of COVID-19 pneumonia in children

- Depending on the severity, antiviral therapy (e.g., with remdesivir) may be recommended.

- See “COVID-19 in children” for more information.

### Prevention

### General preventative measures

- Educate caregivers and patients about hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene.

- Encourage breastfeeding. [14]

- Children attending daycare have an increased risk of pneumonia; alternatives may be preferable for high-risk infants.  [15]

- Advise caregivers to keep immunizations up-to-date (see also “Immunization schedule”).

### Immunizations [1]

- During each pregnancy, advise mothers to get a booster for:  [1]

- Influenza

- Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis

- Ensure children receive recommended immunizations.

- Pneumococcal vaccines

- Hib vaccine

- Pertussis vaccine (DTap, Tdap)

- Annual influenza vaccine

- COVID-19 vaccine

### Pharmacotherapy for high-risk children

- For the RSV season: RSV prophylaxis

- COVID-19

- Consider preexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19.

- Confirmed infection: COVID-19 pharmacotherapy for children

- Cystic fibrosis patients: Consider long-term azithromycin (see “Prevention of infection in CF”).
