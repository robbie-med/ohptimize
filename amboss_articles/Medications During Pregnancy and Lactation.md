# Pharmacotherapy during pregnancy

### Summary
Pharmacotherapy during pregnancy is an important concern for a medical professional because there are only a limited number of drugs that can be safely administered during this period. Many drugs can cause harm to the fetus in the form of defects in organogenesis, growth restriction, and functional deficits. The aim of drug selection in this period is to prescribe an agent that effectively alleviates the mother's medical complaints while ensuring the safety of the unborn fetus. This article provides a brief overview of drugs that can be used for common conditions in pregnant women. It also lists the substances that should be avoided during pregnancy.CollapseNotesFeedback

Second-generation antihistamines (e.g., loratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine) may be considered if chlorpheniramine is not tolerated. Loratadine is the best-studied second-generation antihistamine.

### Overview of medication safety in pregnancy

- While medications are commonly used for both acute and chronic conditions during pregnancy, most drugs have not been studied in pregnant individuals.  [30]

- The FDA's 2015 Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) requires prescription drug labels to include all available safety information.  [31]

- Use shared decision-making when considering pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. [32]

- For patients with chronic conditions, review options during preconception counseling.

- Before prescribing during pregnancy, review the potential risks and benefits to the mother, fetus, and newborn.

- Advise patients that safety data for over-the-counter drugs and supplements are similarly limited.
