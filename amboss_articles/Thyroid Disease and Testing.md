Maximize table Table Quiz
| Overview of clinical features in thyroid-related disorders |
| --- |
|  | Hypothyroidism | Hyperthyroidism |
| Ocular | Periorbital edema | Lid lag Lid retraction (“staring look”) Graves ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos, periorbital edema) |
| Vocal | Hoarse voice, difficulty articulating words | Tremulous voice |
| Dermatological | Cold, dry skin Decreased sweating Puffy appearance Pretibial edema Coarse hair Hair loss Brittle nails | Warm, moist skin Excessive sweating Infiltrative dermopathy, especially in the pretibial area (pretibial myxedema) Fine hair Diffuse hair loss Onycholysis |
| Thyroid | Goiter (in Hashimoto thyroiditis) Atrophic thyroid (in atrophic thyroiditis) | Diffuse, smooth, nontender goiter, often with audible bruit (in Graves disease) |
| Metabolic | Cold intolerance Fatigue, decreased physical activity Weight gain (despite decreased appetite) | Heat intolerance Weakness, fatigue Weight loss (despite increased appetite) |
| Cardiovascular | Bradycardia Myxedematous heart disease (dilated cardiomyopathy, bradycardia, dyspnea) Decreased cardiac output | Tachycardia Palpitations, irregular pulse Hypertension with widened pulse pressure Increased systolic pressure Decreased diastolic pressure Abnormal heart rhythms (e.g., atrial fibrillation) Chest pain |
| Musculoskeletal | Hypothyroid myopathy (proximal muscle weakness with elevated creatine kinase levels) Entrapment syndromes (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome) Myoedema | Hyperthyroid myopathy (proximal muscle weakness with normal creatinine kinase levels) Osteopathy (osteoporosis) |
| Gastrointestinal | Constipation | Frequent bowel movements (due to intestinal hypermotility) |
| Reproductive | Abnormal menstrual cycle (secondary amenorrhea or menorrhagia) Galactorrhea Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and infertility in men | ♀: oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulatory infertility, dysfunctional uterine bleeding ♂: gynecomastia, decreased libido, infertility, erectile dysfunction |
| Neuropsychiatric | Impaired cognition (concentration, memory) Somnolence Depression Hyporeflexia Woltman sign | Anxiety Restlessness Insomnia Tremulousness (e.g., fine tremor in outstretched fingers) Hyperreflexia |

### Thyroid function tests

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Overview of thyroid function tests in thyroid disorders |
| --- |
| ‎ | Etiology | Thyroid function tests |
| TSH level | Free T4 | Free T3 |
| Overt hypothyroidism | Primary hypothyroidism | Hashimoto thyroiditis (most common cause) Iatrogenic (e.g., following thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy) Antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, lithium) Transient hypothyroidism (e.g., silent thyroiditis, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis) | ↑ | ↓ |
| Secondary hypothyroidism | Pituitary disorders (e.g., pituitary adenoma) Infiltrative diseases Iatrogenic (e.g., following pituitary surgery) | ↓ |
| Tertiary hypothyroidism | Hypothalamic disorders |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism | Asymptomatic Same etiology as primary hypothyroidism | Mildly ↑ | Normal |
| Euthyroid sick syndrome | Low T3 syndrome | Occurs in severe illness or severe physical stress (most common in intensive care patients) | Normal | Normal | ↓ |
| Low T3 low T4 syndrome | ↓ |
| Primary hyperthyroidism | Graves disease Toxic MNG Toxic adenoma (see “Thyroid nodules” and “Thyroid cancer”) Postpartum thyroiditis Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain thyroiditis) | ↓ | ↑ |
| Secondary hyperthyroidism | Thyrotropic adenoma | Normal/↑ |
| Subclinical hyperthyroidism | Same etiology as primary hyperthyroidism | ↓ | Normal |
