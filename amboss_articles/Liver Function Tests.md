# Laboratory medicine

### Summary
Laboratory medicine involves the analysis and evaluation of body fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the results of which are important for the prevention, diagnosis, and staging of diseases. Even though laboratory medicine plays an important role in daily clinical practice, the evaluation of results should always take into account the patient's medical history as well as clinical and diagnostic findings. This article covers important laboratory parameters, such as hematological parameters, iron studies, coagulation studies, parameters of certain organ functions, and inflammatory markers. Further parameters of clinical relevance may be found in other articles and are listed in the section “Overview of important laboratory parameters.” If not otherwise indicated, the reference ranges provided here are consistent with those used by the NBME.CollapseNotesFeedback

### Iron studies

- Iron is a trace element that is essential for hematopoiesis.

- Iron is required for the synthesis of heme and, subsequently, of hemoglobin.

- See “Iron” in “Trace elements.”

- Iron studies are particularly important in the differential diagnosis of anemia.

- See also “Hematological parameters” above.

- See the articles “Anemia” and “Iron deficiency anemia.”

| --- |
| Laboratory parameter | Reference range | Description | Common causes of elevation | Common causes of reduction |
| Serum iron | Male: 65–175 μg/dL Female: 50–170 μg/dL | Measurement of circulating iron, most of which is bound to transferrin Serum iron levels are subject to physiological daily fluctuation and can be influenced by dietary intake. | Iron overload, e.g., due to: Hemochromatosis Repeated transfusions Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., in thalassemia) Increased iron intake (e.g., due to oversupplementation) Iron poisoning Sideroblastic anemia | Iron deficiency, e.g., due to: Hemorrhage Malnutrition Increased demand (e.g., in pregnancy) Anemia of chronic disease |
| Ferritin | Male: 20–250 ng/mL Female: 10–120 ng/mL | Main storage protein for iron | Acute phase reaction  Anemia of chronic disease Iron overload Sideroblastic anemia | Iron deficiency: Ferritin is the parameter of choice in diagnosing iron deficiency. |
| Transferrin* | 200–360 mg/dL | Transport protein for iron  Can be reported as total iron binding capacity (TIBC) | Iron deficiency Pregnancy | Inflammation: Transferrin is a negative acute phase reactant. Iron overload |
| Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) | 250–400 μg/dL | Indirect measure of transferrin (same diagnostic value) | Anemia of chronic disease Iron overload |

|  | * There are two additional forms of transferrin that may be used for diagnosis: beta-2 transferrin (used for the detection of a CSF leak in skull fractures) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (used to detect heavy alcohol consumption). |

In combination with an elevated TIBC, low hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron levels are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.
Elevated ferritin levels do not rule out iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin can be elevated in response to simultaneous chronic inflammation.

### Coagulation studies

### Most common tests

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Overview of coagulation parameters [14] |

| Parameter | Reference range | Description | Pathways tested | Clinical relevance |
| Common | Intrinsic | Extrinsic |
| Prothrombin time (PT) | 11–15 seconds | Time it takes to produce fibrin polymers after adding thromboplastin and calcium | ✓ |  | ✓ | Increased in: Vitamin K deficiency Impaired coagulation factor production (e.g., in cirrhosis) Factor VII deficiency DIC Monitoring of vitamin K antagonist therapy (INR) |

| Reptilase time | 14–24 seconds [16] | Time it takes to produce fibrin polymers after adding reptilase | ✓ |  |  | Test for fibrinogen deficiency |

### Additional tests

- Bleeding time: amount of time it takes for a bleeding to stop after a small skin puncture

- Prolonged in disorders of primary hemostasis (thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction)

- Not routinely performed [17]

- Anti-factor Xa assay: used to monitor certain anticoagulant therapies

- Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux therapy in patients with impaired renal function

- Unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy if aPTT is inconclusive (e.g., due to coagulation factor deficiency or heparin antibodies)

- D-dimer: fibrin degradation product that correlates with activity of coagulation and fibrinolysis

- High sensitivity: Increased serum D-dimer levels occur in deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

- Low specificity: Elevation can also occur due to other conditions, including malignancies, infection, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, or surgical procedures.

- Ristocetin cofactor assay: measures the ability of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to agglutinate platelets ;  [18]

- Ristocetin: antibiotic that activates vWF, which then binds to glycoprotein Ib on platelets

- Interpretation: If ristocetin is added to blood lacking vWF (or the vWF receptor), platelets will not agglutinate.

- Von Willebrand disease (↓ vWF)

- Failure of platelet agglutination or a ristocetin cofactor level < 30 IU/dL that corrects with the addition of normal plasma

- Normal platelet agglutination in response to other agonists such as ADP, epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin

- Bernard-Soulier syndrome (↓ vWF receptor on platelets)

- Failure of platelet agglutination or a ristocetin cofactor level < 30 IU/dL that does not correct with the addition of normal plasma

- Normal platelet agglutination in response to other agonists such as ADP, epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin

- Glanzmann thrombasthenia

- Normal platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin

- Failure of platelet agglutination in response to other agonists such as ADP, epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin

- Coagulation factor assays: e.g., reduced factor VIII activity in hemophilia A

- Clot observation test: simple method of point-of-care testing to assess coagulation, especially if hyperfibrinolysis is suspected

- Procedure: A small amount of blood is collected in a test tube and examined macroscopically after a few minutes.

- Interpretation

- Stable thrombus formation : normal coagulation

- No thrombi formation: severely impaired coagulation (e.g., in DIC)

- Formation of an unstable thrombus that dissolves quickly: hyperfibrinolysis

- Thromboelastography: full blood assay that assesses the formation, stability, and dissolution of a thrombus alongside PT and aPTT

- Rumpel-Leede test: detects primary hemostasis disorders and increased dermal capillary fragility

- Procedure: A tourniquet is applied to the upper arm and the cuff is inflated to a pressure that is midway between the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure. After 5 minutes, the tourniquet is removed and the cubital pit and forearm are examined for petechiae.

- Interpretation

- Test is positive if ≥ 10 petechiae appear per square inch.

- Positive test results occur in:

- Dengue hemorrhagic fever

- Disorders affecting primary hemostasis (e.g., thrombocytopenia)

- Increased capillary fragility (e.g., prolonged steroid use, scurvy)

- Vascular hemorrhagic diathesis (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, IgA vasculitis)

- Scarlet fever

### Liver chemistries

### Parameters of hepatocellular damage

- Damage to hepatocytes results in the release of various enzymes that are then detectable in the blood.

- These parameters may help to evaluate the cause and severity of hepatic cell damage.

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Laboratory parameters of hepatocellular damage |
| --- |
| Laboratory parameter | Physiological function | Characteristics | Common causes of elevation |
| Transaminases (aminotransferases) | Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) | Enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis and the generation of urea | Specific to the cytoplasm of hepatocytes | All types of hepatocyte damage (see “AST/ALT ratio”) Muscle damage (esp. AST) Myocardial infarction (esp. AST) Significant elevation (> 1,000 U/L) Hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., acetaminophen) Some hepatitis subtypes (e.g., autoimmune, ischemic, or acute viral hepatitis) |
| Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) | Enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism | Present in the liver, heart, muscle, and erythrocytes In hepatocytes, AST is located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. |
| Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) | An enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism | Only present in the mitochondria of hepatocytes Marker for severe hepatocellular damage | Severe hepatitis Toxins (e.g., α-amanitin) Hepatocellular carcinoma, liver metastases |

Always begin evaluating the asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes with a thorough history to exclude risk factors for hepatitis (e.g., alcohol or recreational drug use).

### AST/ALT ratio

- The ratio of AST serum levels to ALT serum levels is used to determine the etiology of hepatocellular injury.

- AST/ALT < 1 (AST < ALT)

- Uncomplicated viral hepatitis

- Minor fatty liver disease

- Extrahepatic cholestasis

- AST/ALT ≥ 1 (AST > ALT)

- Alcohol-associated hepatitis

- Typically AST/ALT > 1.5

- AST usually does not exceed 400 U/L in alcohol-associated hepatitis.

- Fulminant, necrotic hepatitis

- (Decompensated) cirrhosis: The AST/ALT ratio can increase as fibrosis advances.

- Hepatocellular carcinoma, liver metastases

- Muscle damage

- Myocardial infarction

### Parameters of cholestasis

- Cholestasis typically leads to an increase in direct (conjugated) bilirubin and induces the production of ALP and γ-GT.

- Fractionating bilirubin (i.e., determining total bilirubin and direct bilirubin) can help to differentiate between cholestasis and other causes of hyperbilirubinemia.

- In cholestasis, the retention of bile salts can additionally lead to hepatocyte damage, resulting in the release of various enzymes (see “Parameters of hepatocellular damage”).

- For more information, see “Jaundice and cholestasis.”

Indirect bilirubin is water-insoluble.

### Synthetic liver function tests

- Liver dysfunction can reduce the hepatic production of various substances, which is reflected in their decreased serum levels.

- The initial evaluation of liver synthesis capacity typically consists of determining serum albumin, PT/INR, and platelet count.

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Electrolytes

- Electrolytes develop when a salt dissolves in a solution, causing it to separate into cations (positively charged) and anions (negatively charged).

- Normal body function requires the appropriate concentrations of the following electrolytes: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and phosphate (H2PO4-, HPO42-).

- More detailed information about electrolyte imbalances can be found in dedicated articles.

### Chloride (Cl-)

- Reference range: 95–105 mEq/L (95–105 mmol/L)

- Physiology

- Cl- is the main anion in the extracellular space and is the counterpart to the main extracellular cation Na+.

- Changes in serum chloride levels typically reflect changes in serum sodium levels.

- An exception to this is in acid-base disorders, which can be caused by or lead to changes in chloride levels independent of sodium.

- Cl- is involved in water balance, maintaining osmotic pressure, and acid-base balance.

### Magnesium (Mg2+)

- Reference range: 1.5–2.0 mg/dL (0.75–1.0 mmol/L)

- Physiology

- Part of bone matrix

- Mg2+ is one of the main intracellular cations.

- Magnesium balance is closely interlinked with calcium and potassium homeostasis.

- An imbalance of one of these electrolytes may be a result of or cause an imbalance in another.

- Magnesium prevents the intracellular accumulation of calcium. A balance of intracellular Mg2+ and extracellular Ca2+ is required to maintain normal neuromuscular activity.

- Magnesium repletion is required for effective treatment of hypocalcemia or hypokalemia.

- Mg2+ is an important cofactor for a large number of enzymes and transporters.

- Regulation of magnesium homeostasis

- Reabsorption rates in the kidneys respond to magnesium serum levels.

- Influenced by a variety of hormones (e.g., PTH, insulin, glucagon, PTH, calcitonin, ADH, corticosteroids)

For more on the effects and treatment of altered magnesium levels, see “Hypomagnesemia” and “Hypermagnesemia.”

### Phosphate (H2PO4-, HPO42-)

- Normal range: 2.5–4.5 mg/dL (1.0–1.5 mmol/L)

- Physiology

- Approx. 85% of the body's phosphate is found in the bone matrix. [23]

- Outside of bone, phosphate is mainly found in the intracellular space (esp. in soft tissue cells).

- Component of many important molecules, including creatine phosphate, membrane phospholipids, DNA, ATP/ADP, 2,3-DPG, and NADP

- Phosphate homeostasis

- Vitamin D stimulates intestinal absorption and release of phosphate from bones.

- PTH stimulates renal phosphate excretion by inhibiting its reabsorption in the kidneys.

For more on the effects and treatment of altered phosphate levels, see “Hypophosphatemia” and “Hyperphosphatemia.”

### Lactic acid (lactate)

### General

- Reference range: < 2.0 mmol/L

- Physiology

- Lactic acid is the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, which is accomplished in the Cori cycle.

- The majority of lactic acid is produced by muscle cells and RBCs, especially in hypoxic states.

### Hyperlactatemia

- Common causes

- Tissue hypoperfusion (hypoxic states)

- Heart failure

- Sepsis and other infections

- Shock

- Infarction

- Lung disease (e.g., pulmonary embolism)

- Dehydration

- Severe anemia and pancytopenia

- Poisoning

- CO (carbon monoxide)

- Ethanol

- Methanol

- Ethylene glycol

- Liver disease

- Drugs (e.g., metformin or isoniazid)

- Thiamine deficiency

- Kidney disease (especially in individuals with diabetes)

- Strenuous exercise

- Clinical features: Symptoms are largely caused by lactic acidosis and compensatory mechanisms. They can include:

- Tachypnea

- Tachycardia

- Nausea, vomiting

- Sweating

- Confusion

### Inflammatory markers

Inflammatory markers are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of a large spectrum of conditions, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. Most inflammatory processes lead to elevated CRP, elevated ESR, and leukocytosis.

### Acute phase reaction [24][25]

- Definition: systemic response to systemic and/or local disturbances (e.g., acute or chronic inflammation, infection, surgery, trauma, malignancy)

- Part of the humoral immune response of the innate immune system

- Consists of:

- Fever

- Leukocytosis

- Increased synthesis of > 30 acute phase reactants

- Produced by the liver

- Synthesis is induced mainly by IL-6.

- Diagnostic use

- Serum levels of acute phase reactants are used to detect and monitor inflammatory processes.

- An increase of acute phase reactants is reflected in an increase in alpha-1 and alpha-2 zones in serum protein electrophoresis.

Time course of inflammatory markers

## Positive acute phase reactants

Hepatic production and serum levels of positive acute phase reactants increase in response to inflammatory processes.

- C-reactive protein (CRP)

- Promotes the opsonization of pathogens, which leads to increased phagocytosis by macrophages

- Activates the complement system

- High sensitivity for detecting inflammation but not specific to any disease or organ

- Increases 6–12 hours after the inflammatory process begins

- Half-life is 24 hours.

- Procalcitonin (PCT)

- Sensitive parameter for monitoring the progression of bacterial infections, especially pneumonia and sepsis

- Peptide precursor of calcitonin

- Ferritin [26][27]

- Serum ferritin levels increase in infection to limit the amount of free iron available to pathogens, as well as in malignancy to limit the amount available to tumor cells.

- In contrast, some organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas) cause serum ferritin levels to drop.

- See “Iron studies.”

- Hepcidin

- Reduces iron available to pathogens by:

- Decreasing intestinal iron absorption (via ferroportin degradation)

- Preventing the release of iron from macrophages

- Can cause anemia of chronic disease

- Haptoglobin: binds free hemoglobin

- Antimicrobial effects: In infection, haptoglobin is upregulated to make extracellular heme iron less available to pathogens.

- Antioxidative effects

- Free hemoglobin (e.g. in hemolysis) can cause oxidative damage.

- Haptoglobin levels decrease in hemolysis.

- Serum amyloid A (SAA)

- Recruits immune cells to inflammatory sites

- Prolonged increased levels may cause amyloidosis.

- Fibrinogen

- Coagulant that promotes wound healing and endothelial repair

- Correlates with ESR

- Von Willebrand factor [28]

- α1-antitrypsin: protection from protease activity

- Interleukin-6 (IL-6)

- Ceruloplasmin: binds free copper and has antioxidative effects [29]

- Complement components

Time course of inflammatory markers

## Negative acute phase reactants

Serum levels of negative acute phase reactants decrease in response to inflammatory processes.

- Albumin: Reduced production of albumin conserves amino acids that can then be used to produce positive acute phase reactants.

- Transferrin: Macrophages take up transferrin and use it to remove iron from circulation, making it unavailable for pathogens.

- Antithrombin

- Transthyretin

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [30]

- Description: distance that erythrocytes (RBCs) descend in a vertical tube of anticoagulated blood over one hour

- Normal ranges

- ♀ 0–20 mm/h

- ♂ 0–15 mm/h

- Common causes of increase

- All conditions associated with ↑ fibrinogen (e.g., infection, inflammation, malignancies)

- Normally, RBCs are separated from each other by their negatively charged surfaces.

- Elevated fibrinogen levels lead to a decrease in the negative charges, causing RBCs to aggregate and sink faster in the test tube.

- Inflammation

- Infection

- Malignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, metastases)

- Autoimmune diseases;  (e.g., SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, de Quervain thyroiditis)

- Anemia

- Macrocytosis

- Renal disease (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, ESRD)

- Pregnancy (leads to ↑ fibrinogen)

- Old age

- Common causes of decrease

- Conditions affecting RBCs

- Polycythemia (the increased number of RBCs lowers the concentration of aggregation factors)

- Sickle cell disease (irregular and smaller RBCs sink slower)

- Spherocytosis

- Microcytosis

- Leukocytosis with very high WBC count (e.g., in chronic lymphocytic leukemia)

- Congestive heart failure (CHF)  [31]

- Hypofibrinogenemia (e.g., in DIC)

- Hypogammaglobulinemia

### White blood cell count

- Inflammation typically causes leukocytosis (> 11,000/mm3).

- Which type of WBC is increased depends on the underlying cause.

- See “Leukocytosis” and “Leukemoid reaction” above.
