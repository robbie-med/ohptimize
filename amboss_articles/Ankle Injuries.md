# Sports injuries

### Summary
This article focuses on injuries that are commonly associated with sporting activities, but they can also occur at work or during activities of daily living. Sports injuries are usually the result of direct trauma or a sudden increased load on the joints, ligaments, and/or muscles. Acute joint and ligament injuries typically result from nonphysiological movements in the joints (e.g., excessive supination of the ankle). Treatment of acute sports injuries usually follows the POLICE principle (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Definitive therapy depends on the extent of the injury (e.g., the presence or absence of fractures) and ranges from immobilization of the affected region (e.g., casts, braces, supportive wraps) to surgical repair. Compression neuropathies, especially of the peripheral nerves of the upper extremity, are commonly associated with sport. In most cases, compression neuropathies can be treated with conservative management (e.g., rest, activity modification, physical therapy); surgical decompression may be considered for those with symptoms that are refractory to conservative management.CollapseNotesFeedback

### Initial management of sports injuries

### Diagnosis [1]

- Clinical evaluation

- Examine the extremity for open injuries or joint deformity.

- Assess active and passive range of motion (ROM).

- Identify areas of tenderness.

- Test for ligamentous injury with stress testing.

- Assess major muscle group strength.

- Perform a thorough neurovascular examination.

- Imaging

- Indicated if there is a concern for fracture and/or dislocation.

- Protocols and guidelines can reduce unnecessary testing.

- Ottawa ankle rules

- Ottawa knee rules

- The threshold to obtain advanced imaging, e.g., MRI, is often lower for professional or elite athletes.

### Treatment by injury phase [2]

The treatment strategy depends on the pathophysiological phase of the injury.

- Acute [2]

- Acute local inflammation

- Clinical features: warmth, erythema, swelling, reduced function

- Duration: typically 1–3 days

- Treatment goals include protecting injured tissue and reducing inflammation.

- Subacute [2]

- Chronic local inflammation and impaired tissue strength

- Clinical features: limited ROM, pain

- Duration: days to months

- Treatment goals include increasing ROM, increasing strength, and improving proprioception.

- Chronic [2]

- Chronic local inflammation and/or excessive collagenous response to the original injury

- Clinical features: pain and stiffness at rest that improves with activity

- Treatment goals include avoiding aggravating activities, maintaining ROM, and reducing chronic inflammation.

### POLICE principle [3][4]

- Protection; : immobilization (e.g., with a brace, crutches) after a brief period of relative rest to prevent further injury

- Optimal Loading

- Frequent movement of the affected limb within a pain-free range in order to restore function

- Optimal loading depends on injury location and severity.

- Ice

- Cool the injured area immediately.  [5][6]

- Apply an ice pack for ≤ 30 minutes each session; repeat as needed for pain control and swelling.

- To reduce the risk of frostbite, do not apply ice directly to the skin.

- Compression

- Use an elastic compression bandage.

- Apply elastic bandage distal to the injury and continue proximally

- A change in the character of pain (e.g., sharp to throbbing pain) may indicate tissue ischemia; remove, assess, and reapply the dressing.

- Taping (tape bandages) should not be used during the first 12–24 hours.

- Continue compression as long as there is a risk of swelling.  [2]

- Elevation: Maintain the injured area above the level of the heart.

### RICE principle

- RICE = Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation

- No longer recommended because early mobilization has been shown to improve postinjury function [2]

### Rehabilitation [7]

The transition from acute care to performance care often involves multiple caregivers, especially for elite athletes and/or major injuries.

- Consider early referral to a sports medicine clinic for comprehensive care.

- Physical therapists can assist with acute care, restoration of motion, and improved neuromuscular coordination.

- Medically directed strength and conditioning programs may be necessary to restore full performance.

### Activity modification for athletes [1][8][9]

## General principles

- Premature return to full activity can worsen acute and overuse injuries, which risks prolonging disability.

- Adherence to activity restriction can be challenging, especially for patients who are highly motivated to continue their sport.

- Consult a sports medicine specialist or the athlete's team physician, whenever available, to guide the activity modification plan.

- Activities likely to exacerbate the injury are best avoided.

- Exercises that maintain tone, ROM, and flexibility of unaffected muscles, bones, or joints are typically safe to continue.

- A gradual return to activity is typically preferred.

## Return to play (RTP)

RTP decisions are complex and involve input from healthcare providers, the patient, and parents or guardians (when applicable).

- Criteria for RTP include:[1][8][9]

- The status of acute or chronic injury makes further harm unlikely.

- The sport-specific function of the injured body part has returned.

- The individual can perform safely (may require a brace, orthotic, or equipment modification).

- Overall musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychological functions have been restored.

- Participation does not put individual or other participants at risk.

- Local and/or governing body regulations are fulfilled.

- Minor injuries: RTP decision can be made on an individual basis by experienced general care providers.

- Major injuries: RTP decisions are best made by sports medicine specialists.

### Ankle sprains

### Definitions [10][11]

- Lateral low ankle sprain: a sprain of ≥ 1 of the following lateral ligaments.

- Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL): most commonly affected [10]

- Calcaneofibular ligament (CFL)

- Posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL)

- Medial low ankle sprain: a sprain of the medial (deltoid ligament) complex which connects the medial malleolus to the talus

- High ankle sprain (syndesmotic ankle sprain): a sprain of the syndesmotic ligaments that connect the tibia and fibula in the lower leg (less common)

Ligaments of the ankle and footLigaments of the ankle and foot

### Etiology [10][11][12]

- Supination injury: excessive inversion of the ankle joint

- Typically injures the ATFL and other lateral ligaments (CFL, PTFL)

- The anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament is most commonly involved in high ankle sprains.

- Pronation injury: excessive eversion of the ankle joint causes a sprain of the medial deltoid ligament

In supination injuries, the Anterior TaloFibular ligament Always Tears First.
The most common cause of an ankle sprain is a forceful inversion of the ankle that damages the lateral ligament.

### Classification [10][11][12]

- Grade I: no macroscopic changes

- Grade II: partial tear

- Grade III: complete tear

### Clinical features [10][11][12]

- Soft tissue swelling

- Limited ROM at the ankle joint

- Tenderness over the sprained ligament

- Increased joint laxity and a prominent talus compared to the uninjured ankle

- Impaired weight-bearing and/or antalgic gait

- Hematoma may be visible

### Diagnosis [10][11][12]

Ankle sprain is a clinical diagnosis.

## Clinical evaluation

- Neurovascular examination: Examine for peroneal nerve injury (can occur with high ankle sprains).

- Ligament integrity tests

- Anterior drawer test of the ankle

- The tibia is held fixed with the knee and ankle at 90° and the foot is grasped behind the heel and pulled in an anterior direction.

- Anterior translation or laxity suggests ATFL rupture.

- Talar tilt test: Supination between the talus and tibia > 25° suggests CFL rupture.

- Kleiger external rotation test: can help identify high ankle sprain

## Ottawa ankle rules

- Used to assess whether x-rays for ankle and midfoot injuries are necessary to identify fractures. [13]

- Ankle x-rays are typically indicated for distal malleolar tenderness and/or inability to bear weight immediately after the injury or at the time of evaluation.

- For detailed criteria, see “Ottawa foot and ankle rules” in “Ankle fractures.”

Ottawa ankle rulesOttawa ankle and foot rules

## Imaging [4]

- If initial x-rays are indicated (e.g., to rule out fracture or dislocation), obtain anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views of the ankle.

- X-rays may appear normal or show evidence of soft-tissue swelling around the medial and/or lateral malleoli.

- See “Ankle fracture” for other abnormal findings.

- Consider MRI extremity for persistent symptoms and/or chronic ankle instability

### Differential diagnosis [10]

- Ankle fracture

- Cuboid syndrome

- Osteochondral lesion

### Treatment [10][11][12]

- Apply the POLICE principle.

- Consider NSAIDs.

- Mild to moderate sprains: Provide functional support (e.g., ankle brace) for 4–6 weeks.

- Severe injuries: Immobilize the ankle.

- A duration of ≤ 10 days is recommended.  [11][12]

- Grade II sprain: lower extremity splint or walking boot

- Grade III sprain: Consider a short leg cast. [14]

- Refer the following to orthopedic surgery: [14]

- Symptoms that do not resolve with conservative management

- Severe grade III lateral ankle sprains

- Medial ligament (deltoid ligament) disruption

- High-grade syndesmotic ankle sprain

- Chronic ankle instability

The majority of lateral ankle sprains can be managed without surgery. [14]

### Prognosis

- Full recovery is likely, but recovery time is related to sprain severity.  [10]

- Chronic ankle instability and/or persistent symptoms are common.  [11]

- Proprioception and balance training prevent recurrent sprains. [11][12]

- The patellar grind test is no longer recommended to evaluate for PFPS.  [19][20]

- Full knee X-ray series is indicated if there is: [18]

- Concern for an alternative diagnosis, e.g., fracture, osteoarthritis, osteochondritis

- No improvement after 4–8 weeks of conservative management

- Consider weight management for overweight or obese patients. [22]

- Surgery (often a last resort) [23]

- Indications: severe knee malalignment, symptoms persist after conservative treatment

- Does not usually provide sustained symptom improvement

### Medial tibial stress syndrome

### Background [24][25]

- Definition: Exercise-induced pain along the posteromedial border of the tibia;  that is not the result of ischemia or a stress fracture; also known as shin splints [25]

- Epidemiology: common in runners and military recruits

- Etiology: overuse injury

- Pathophysiology: periostitis with an imbalance of bone formation and resorption in the tibial cortex, which causes increased bone degradation

### Clinical features

- Exercise-induced pain along the middle and distal posteromedial tibia

- Early stages: Pain begins with activity and resolves during continued exercise.

- Late stages: Pain persists during exercise and may continue at rest.

- Tenderness of the surrounding muscles

- Diffuse tenderness of the distal two-thirds of the posteromedial border of the tibia

### Diagnosis

- Clinical diagnosis: typical clinical features and absence of pathological findings other than minimal swelling (e.g., no neurovascular injury, warmth, or significant swelling)

- Imaging

- Obtain only if the diagnosis is unclear. [24][25]

- MRI may help differentiate MTSS from tibial stress fractures.

### Differential diagnosis of exercise-induced leg pain [25]

- Medial tibial stress syndrome

- Tibial stress fracture  [25]

- Exertional compartment syndrome

- Nerve or vascular entrapment

### Treatment

- POLICE principle

- Immobilization and/or bracing are not recommended.

### Knee tendon injuries

### Overview

Tendinous injuries of the knee include patellar tendon rupture or tear and quadriceps tendon rupture or tear.

## Shared features

- History of quadriceps contraction with the foot planted (more strongly associated with quadriceps tendon rupture)

- Clinical features of acute internal knee derangement, e.g., sudden pain, swelling, decreased ROM

- Impaired or absent active knee extension

## Distinguishing features

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Distinguishing features of knee tendon injuries |
| --- |
|  | Patellar tendon rupture | Quadriceps tendon rupture |
| Etiology | Direct trauma to the infrapatellar region | Direct trauma to the suprapatellar region |
| Clinical features | Palpable gap in tendon inferior to the patella High-riding patella on examination | Palpable gap in tendon superior to the patella Low-riding patella on examination Cracking or tearing sensation |

### Muscle injuries

### Muscle strain [31][32][33]

- Definition: injury to myofibers resulting from forceful contraction or excessive stretching [4][32]

- Etiology

- Muscles are stretched beyond the elastic limit during active contraction.

- Site of injury is usually at the musculotendinous junction.

- Classification [33][34]

- Grade I: < 5% of muscle fibers are damaged.

- Grade II: 5–99% of muscle fibers are torn (incomplete rupture).

- Treatment [31][32]

- POLICE principle

- Immobilization for 3–5 days

- NSAIDS for 2–3 days  [31][32]

- Exercise therapy after resolution of the acute inflammatory phase

- Other

- Hematoma aspiration [31]

- Definition: painful feeling of tension in the muscles 1–2 days after increased physical activity

- Etiology

- Climbing uphill

- Eccentric strength training

- Sports that involve jumping, acceleration, deceleration, and sudden changes in direction

- Pathophysiology

- Microtears close to the Z-line of the sarcomere → stimulation of muscle hypertrophy

- If the load or the level of physical activity is too high → inflammatory reaction near the Z-line → greater muscle repair and less muscle hypertrophy and pain due to muscle edema

- Based on current knowledge, the build-up of lactate does not play a role in muscle soreness. [40][41]

- Clinical features

- Pain on moving and/or stretching the affected muscles, muscle tenderness

- Pain peaks after 1–3 days

- Muscle stiffness

- Diagnostics: clinical diagnosis

- Treatment:

- Avoid rest

- Conservative management

- In most cases, compression neuropathies can be treated with conservative management.

- The optimal duration of conservative management varies from 3 to 12 months depending on the nerve involved and symptom severity. [43]

- Measures include:

- Patient education

- Relative rest [42]

- Activity modification to prevent further nerve compression

- Symptom management (e.g., analgesia, splinting)

- Physical therapy (e.g., range of motion exercises, exercises to strengthen compensatory muscles)

- Surgical decompression: Consider for individuals with refractory symptoms.
