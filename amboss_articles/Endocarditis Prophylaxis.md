# Infective endocarditis

### Summary

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardium that typically affects one or more heart valves. The condition is usually due to bacteremia, which in adults is most commonly caused by dental procedures, surgery, distant primary infections, and nonsterile injections. Risk factors in children include congenital heart defects and invasive procedures. IE may be acute (developing over hours or days) or subacute (developing over weeks to months). Acute bacterial endocarditis is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and may cause rapid destruction of endocardial tissue. Subacute bacterial endocarditis is most commonly caused by viridans streptococci and usually affects individuals with preexisting damage to the heart valves, congenital heart defects, and/or prosthetic valves. Clinical features are similar in adults and children and include constitutional symptoms (e.g., fatigue, fever, chills, malaise) and signs of pathological cardiac changes (e.g., new or changed heart murmur, heart failure signs). Some patients develop symptoms of organ damage (e.g., glomerulonephritis, septic embolic stroke). Management is complex and early involvement of infectious diseases is recommended. The 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria are used to assess the likelihood of IE, and the diagnosis is confirmed based on culture, histopathology, and/or imaging findings. Initial treatment consists of empiric IV antibiotics, which are adjusted based on blood culture results and continued for several weeks. Distinguishing between native and prosthetic valve IE allows for more tailored treatment. Surgery may be necessary in complex cases (e.g., valve perforation). IE prophylaxis is recommended in specific circumstances (e.g., in patients with congenital heart disease undergoing certain dental procedures). IE is typically fatal if left untreated.

### Pathophysiology

- Pathogenesis [3]

- Damaged valvular endothelium → exposure of the subendothelial layer → adherence of platelets and fibrin → sterile vegetation (microthrombus)

- Localized infection or contamination → bacteremia → bacterial colonization of vegetation → formation of fibrin clots encasing the vegetation → valve destruction with loss of function (valve regurgitation)   [13]

- Valve involvement [12]

- Frequency of valve involvement: mitral valve > aortic valve > tricuspid valve > pulmonary valve

- The tricuspid valve is the most commonly affected valve in individuals who inject drugs (associated with Pseudomonas, S. aureus, and Candida).

- Clinical consequences [3][13]

- Bacterial vegetation → bacterial thromboemboli → vessel occlusion → infarctions

- Emboli can lead to metastatic infections of other organs.

- Formation of immune complexes and antibodies against tissue antigens → glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes

### Clinical features

Clinical features of infective endocarditis

### Constitutional symptoms [3][14]

- Fever and chills (seen in ∼ 90% of patients) [3]

- Tachycardia

- General malaise, weakness, weight loss, night sweats

- Dyspnea, cough, pleuritic chest pain

- Arthralgias, myalgias

Patients with subacute IE often present with nonspecific flu-like symptoms, while patients with acute IE often present with signs of acute sepsis.
A high index of suspicion is required in patients with risk factors for IE, as classic extracardiac manifestations (e.g., splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions) are absent in the majority of patients. [8][15]

### Cardiac manifestations [3][14]

- Development of a new heart murmur or change in a preexisting murmur (seen in ∼ 75% of patients) [3];

- Tricuspid valve regurgitation

- Holosystolic murmur that is loudest at the left sternal border

- Seen in individuals who inject drugs, immunocompromised individuals, patients with congenital heart disease, and patients with instrumentation in the right heart (e.g., central venous catheters) [4]

- Aortic valve regurgitation: early diastolic murmur that is loudest at ; the left 3rd and 4thintercostal spaces and along the left sternal border  [6]

- Mitral valve regurgitation: holosystolic murmur that is loudest at the heart's apex and radiates to the left axilla

- Heart failure (e.g., dyspnea, lower limb edema) due to valve insufficiency

- Arrhythmias: Suspect a perivalvular abscess in patients with IE who develop a new conduction abnormality (e.g., heart block).  [16]

### Extracardiac manifestations of IE [3][14]

Extracardiac manifestations are typically caused by septic microemboli and/or immune complex precipitation and are more commonly seen in left-sided IE, with the exception of pulmonary embolic manifestations, which are more common in right-sided IE.  [3][17]

- Peripheral embolic and immunologic phenomena of IE: seen in only 5–10% of patients.  [3][17]

- Petechiae, especially splinter hemorrhages (hemorrhages underneath fingernails)

- Janeway lesions

- Small, nontender, erythematous macules on palms and soles

- Microabscesses with neutrophilic capillary infiltration and areas of hemorrhage caused by septic microemboli from valve vegetations

- Osler nodes: painful nodules on pads of the fingers and toes caused by immune complex deposition

- Roth spots: round retinal hemorrhages with pale centers

- Emboli to intraabdominal organs

- Acute renal injury

- Including hematuria and anuria

- Due to renal artery occlusion or glomerulonephritis

- Splenomegaly and possible LUQ pain

- Due to splenic artery occlusion or splenic abscess

- May lead to splenic rupture [18]

- Neurological manifestations:  (e.g., seizures, paresis): due to septic embolic stroke, hemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, and/or abscess  [19][20]

- Pulmonary manifestations: caused by septic emboli resulting from tricuspid valve involvement

- Signs of pulmonary embolism (e.g., dyspnea)

- Signs of pulmonary infection, e.g., multifocal pneumonia, lung abscess, and/or empyema. [21]

- Others: Arthritis

Up to one-third of patients with left-sided IE present with symptoms of stroke. [20]
IE should always be considered as a cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO), especially in the presence of a new heart murmur.
“FROM JANE:” Features of IE include Fever, Roth spots, Osler nodes, Murmur, Janeway lesions, Anemia, Nail bed hemorrhage, and Emboli.

### Classification

- IE can be classified by:

- Type of affected valve (native vs. prosthetic)

- Acuity of the infection

- Location of the infection (left- vs. right-sided)

- Although this is not a definitive classification system, it can help in the approach to management and selection of empiric antibiotic regimens.

### Diagnosis

### Approach [17][23]

- Suspect IE in patients with clinical features (e.g., fever of unclear etiology and a new heart murmur) and predisposing conditions.

- Use the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria to determine the diagnostic likelihood of IE: definite, possible, or rejected. [8]

- Intended as a diagnostic guide and not a substitute for clinical judgment

- Incorporates clinical, microbiological, pathological, and imaging criteria

- Order echocardiography and multiple sets of blood cultures for all patients.

- Obtain ECG and additional imaging to investigate complications, new focal symptoms, and/or signs of metastatic infection.

- Consider serology to evaluate for blood culture-negative endocarditis.

- Consult infectious diseases if there is diagnostic uncertainty.

Draw three sets of blood cultures from different venipuncture sites as soon as IE is suspected, preferably before initiating antibiotic treatment.

### Duke criteria

Maximize table Table Quiz
| 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria [1] |
| --- |
| Criteria | Findings |
| Pathological | Identification of one of the following in tissue or an implanted artificial material:  Pathogens in patients with clinical features of IE  Characteristic histological features of active IE |
| Clinical | Major | Typical pathogens in IE from ≥ 2 separate blood culture sets Nontypical pathogens in IE isolated from ≥ 3 separate blood culture sets C. burnetii in a single blood culture and/or another study (e.g., PCR, anti-phase 1 IgG titer) Bartonella spp. or T. whipplei on blood molecular testing (e.g., PCR) IgM and IgG antibodies to Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana on IFA, with IgG titer ≥ 1:800 Characteristic findings of IE on echocardiogram and/or cardiac CT scan (e.g., new valvular regurgitation) 18F-FDG PET/CT scan with findings suggestive of IE Surgical evidence of IE on direct tissue inspection during cardiac surgery |

The modified Duke criteria were revised in 2023 to improve diagnostic sensitivity for IE and have now been replaced by the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria.

### Laboratory studies [17]

## Routine studies [2]

Laboratory findings are nonspecific but may be used to assess disease severity.

- CBC: : leukocytosis (may show left shift), leukopenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia

- Inflammatory markers: : ↑ CRP, ↑ ESR  [23]

- CMP: Elevated creatinine and liver chemistries indicate end organ damage.

- Serum lactate: may be elevated

- Cardiac biomarkers: Troponin and BNP may be elevated. [24]

- Urinalysis: Hematuria and/or nephritic sediment may be present.  [15][25]

## Blood cultures [26]

- Blood sample collection

- Before treatment: three sets of bacterial cultures from different venipuncture sites

- During treatment: two sets from separate venipuncture sites every 24–48 hours until bacteremia resolves

- Interpretation

- Positive cultures are interpreted using the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria.

- Negative cultures cannot rule out IE as any of the following may produce a negative result:  [8][26][27]

- Antibiotic therapy before blood culture sampling

- Fastidious bacteria (most commonly C. burnetii or Bartonella spp.)  [15]

- Fungal infection

- Noninfective endocarditis

Negative blood cultures cannot rule out IE since some patients with IE have sterile cultures.

### Echocardiography [1][2][17]

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial test of choice for all patients with suspected IE. TTE should ideally be performed within 12 hours of presentation and if new complications are suspected. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more invasive and should be considered in selected cases. [2]

- Indications for TEE include:

- Presence of high-risk features

- TTE findings inconclusive or suggestive of IE  [2]

- Patients due to undergo surgery

- Concern for intracardiac complications (e.g., abscess)

- Selected patients based on detected pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, E. faecalis, Streptococcus spp.)

- Findings of IE on echocardiogram: 2023 Duke-ISCVID imaging major criteria have expanded on the modified Duke major criteria. ;  [8][28][29]

- Valvular vegetations: hyperechoic mobile masses located on the valve, mural endocardium, or prosthetic material  [30]

- Abscess (e.g., perivalvular abscess  )

- New valvular regurgitation (especially in patients with valve prolapse, perforation, and/or destruction)

- New partial prosthetic valve dehiscence

- Valvular or leaflet aneurysm or perforation

- Pseudoaneurysm

- Intracardiac fistula

TEE is more sensitive (∼ 90%) than TTE (∼ 75%) and is more reliable for ruling out IE in patients with moderate to high pretest probability.

### Additional studies for IE [17][26]

- Serology

- To assess for culture-negative endocarditis, e.g.:

- C. burnetii anti-phase I IgG titer (> 1:800)

- B. henselae or B. quintana IgG titer (≥ 1:800)

- Limitations: cross-reactivity between different pathogens, confounding from prior infections

- Molecular testing (e.g., PCR, RNA sequencing): to assess for culture-negative endocarditis (e.g., due to C. burnetii, Bartonella spp., T. whipplei)

- Tissue sampling (after surgery)

- Histopathology of resected valves (gold standard)  [26][31]

- Gram stain and culture: to plan the duration of postoperative antimicrobial therapy  [26]

- Molecular testing (e.g., T. whipplei PCR)  [31]

- ECG: indicated in all patients to assess for complications (e.g., AV block or bundle branch blocks in paravalvular extension)  [8][23]

- Dental assessment: in all patients receiving treatment for IE regardless of the initial source of bacteremia

- Colonoscopy: in patients with bacteremia due to S. gallolyticus to rule out colon cancer and mucosal lesions

Obtain an ECG in all patients with suspected IE to assess for new conduction abnormalities that indicate a perivalvular or myocardial abscess (e.g., AV block, bundle branch block). If present, consider urgent cardiac imaging (e.g., TEE, cardiac MRI). [8][23]

## Imaging

Additional imaging may be performed if echocardiography is inconclusive and in selected patients to assess for complications.

- Cardiac CTA [2]

- Consider in possible IE for diagnostic confirmation and/or assessment of valvular lesions.

- Consider in native or prosthetic valve IE to assess for paravalvular or periprosthetic complications if TTE and TEE are inconclusive.

- 18F-FDG PET/CT: Consider to evaluate for IE in patients with a prosthetic valve. [32][33][34]

- CXR: The presence of multiple pulmonary infiltrates may suggest right-sided IE.  [15]

- Abdominal ultrasound: if splenic abscess or infarction is suspected

- MRI head: Consider to assess for intracranial septic emboli.

### Pathology

- Acute disease (leading to valve insufficiency, septic embolic infarcts, tendinous cord rupture) [35]

- Erosion → fibrin deposits on valves

- Ulceration

- Perforation

- Chronic disease (leading to valve insufficiency and valve stenosis) [35]

- Erosion → reorganization of fibrin layer

- Granulation tissue → valve scarring/fibrosis

- Calcification → thickened and/or shortened tendinous cords

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Differential diagnoses

### Noninfective endocarditis (nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis) [36][37]

- Description

- Rare, noninfective form of endocarditis due to sterile platelet thrombus formation on the heart valves (usually mitral and aortic valves)

- Libman-Sacks endocarditis: a type of noninfective endocarditis with verrucous vegetations in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome [36]

- Etiology

- Malignancy (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma)

- Hypercoagulable states

- Underlying trauma (e.g., from indwelling vascular catheters)

- Previous rheumatic fever

- Autoimmune conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome) [38]

- Chronic infections (e.g., TB, pneumonia, osteomyelitis)

- Clinical features

- Valves and cardiac function are rarely impaired.

- Compared to IE, vegetations are easily dislodged and embolization is common, leading to hemorrhages under the nails, skin, and retina

- Most affected individuals are asymptomatic until embolization occurs.

- Diagnostics

- Negative blood cultures

- Echocardiography: valve vegetations

- Biopsy (definitive diagnosis)

- Sterile vegetations on either surface of the valve composed of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, and thrombi interwoven with fibrin strands

- Not always feasible, therefore diagnosis is mostly made based on clinical findings, negative blood cultures, echocardiography findings, and no response to antibiotic treatment

- Treatment

- Anticoagulation with heparin

- Treatment of the underlying condition

### Other

- Intravascular catheter infection

- Infection of prosthetic implants (e.g., prosthetic valves, joints, cardiac electronic devices)

- Prosthetic valve thrombosis

- Hematogenous osteomyelitis

- Septic thrombophlebitis

The differential diagnoses listed here are not exhaustive.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Treatment

### Initial management [8][17][32][39]

- Unstable patients: Use the ABCDE approach and initiate management of sepsis as needed.

- Consults   [40]

- Consult infectious diseases (ID) early to plan treatment and consider empiric therapy.

- Identify patients with indications for surgery consult in IE.

- Antibiotic therapy

- Start empiric antibiotic therapy for IE once blood cultures have been sampled.  [8][39]

- Switch to targeted antibiotic therapy for IE once blood culture results are available. [8][39]

- Supportive care: Treat urgent complications (e.g., AHF, heart block) and the underlying cause (e.g., removal of infected central lines).

If IE is suspected, first obtain blood cultures, then consult ID to plan empiric antibiotic therapy. When culture results are available, adapt the therapy accordingly.

### Antibiotics

## Empiric antibiotic therapy for IE [17][41]

The goal of empiric antibiotic therapy is to provide broad-spectrum coverage for potential bacterial causes of IE (including multidrug-resistant organisms) until blood culture results are available.

- Choice of empiric agents: Consult infectious diseases and consider patient and disease factors as well as local and individual flora and resistance patterns (see “Risk factors for IE” and “Classification”).

- Example regimen [41]

- Vancomycin (off-label) DOSAGE  OR daptomycin (off-label) DOSAGE   [17][41]

- PLUS a beta-lactam (e.g., ceftriaxone DOSAGE  OR cefepime (off-label) DOSAGE ) [17]

- PLUS gentamicin and rifampin in selected cases (e.g., prosthetic valve IE) in consultation with infectious diseases

## Targeted antibiotic therapy [17]

Targeted antibiotic therapy based on culture and sensitivity results is recommended for all patients with IE.

- Common targeted antibiotic regimens

- Staphylococci

- Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (e.g., MSSA): antistaphylococcal beta-lactam (e.g., nafcillin, oxacillin)

- Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (e.g., MRSA): vancomycin

- Prosthetic valve IE (≤ 1 year after placement): Add gentamicin PLUS rifampin.

- Viridans group streptococci:  beta-lactam (e.g., penicillin G, ampicillin)

- Enterococci: combination therapy (e.g., ampicillin PLUS gentamicin)

- HACEK: ceftriaxone (first line)

- Oral step-down therapy: After initial IV antibiotics, the course may be completed with oral antibiotics in selected patients in consultation with infectious diseases. [2][41]

- Duration of therapy: depends on various factors (e.g., drug regimen, affected valve) and may be continued for more than 2–6 weeks after the first sterile blood culture

- Blood culture-negative endocarditis: targeted therapy based on additional studies (e.g., serology)

| HACEK | First line: ceftriaxone DOSAGE OR one of the following: Ampicillin DOSAGE Ciprofloxacin DOSAGE |

### Surgery [2][17][40]

The decision to perform surgery is typically made by a multidisciplinary team comprising cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, and infectious diseases.

- Indications for surgery consult in IE include:

- Prosthetic valve IE

- Valve dysfunction causing heart failure

- Uncontrolled infection (e.g., enlarging vegetation, persistent bacteremia)

- Perivalvular extension or complications (e.g., abscess, pseudoaneurysm, fistula, heart block)

- IE due to difficult to treat organisms (e.g., fungi, MDRO)

- High embolic risk (e.g., mobile vegetation ≥ 10 mm, recurrent embolism) [2]

- Surgical options: valve replacement or valve repair (see “Treatment” in “Valvular heart diseases”)

- Complications

- Acute surgical complications (e.g., rebleeding from surgical sites, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, pneumonia)

- Cardiac complications (e.g., CHF, myocarditis, pericarditis, new AV block)

- Systemic emboli (e.g., stroke)

Surgery is required in 50–60% of patients with IE. [40]

### Supportive care

- Antithrombotic agents  [17][32]

- Consider holding existing anticoagulation if CNS emboli are present.

- Continue long-term antiplatelet therapy if there is no bleeding

- Initiation of antithrombotic therapy is not routinely recommended.

- Cardiovascular complications: See “Acute heart failure management” and “Management of heart block.” [42]

- Others

- Remove infected central lines and CIEDs [43][44]

- Treat opioid use disorder if present, e.g., in IV drug use.  [45][46]

- Inpatient dental evaluation

- No penicillin allergy: amoxicillin (off-label) DOSAGE  OR ampicillin (off-label) DOSAGE  OR cefazolin (off-label for children) DOSAGE

- Severe penicillin reaction: azithromycin;  (off-label) DOSAGE  OR doxycycline (off-label) DOSAGE

- Prior to CIED placement: cefazolin DOSAGE

- Pathogen-specific agents may be indicated depending on the site of the procedure.  [32]

IE prophylaxis is not routinely recommended prior to nondental procedures (including respiratory, skin, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary procedures) unless infected tissue is present. [32]

### Special patient groups

### Infective endocarditis in children [51][52]

## Epidemiology [52]

- Incidence: approx. 0.05–0.12 cases per 1000 hospital admissions [52]

- 7.3% of pediatric IE occurs in neonates. [52]

## Etiology [51][52]

- Common pathogens in children [52]

- S. aureus

- Viridans streptococci [51]

- Enterococcus

- Coagulase-negative staphylococci

- Gram-negative bacteria

- Candida spp.

- Beta-hemolytic streptococci (e.g., S. pyogenes) [51]

- Risk factors for IE in children  [47][52]

- Congenital heart defects  [52]

- Intravascular devices (e.g., central line)

- Previous cardiac surgery (e.g., prosthetic heart valves)  [52]

- Rheumatic heart disease  [52]

Dental procedures may cause transient bacteremia, but the risk for IE is very low. [52]

## Clinical features [52]

- Clinical features of IE are similar in adults and children, with the following exceptions:

- Older children: Arthritis is common.

- Infants: Septic emboli and neurological findings (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis) are common.

- Neonates:

- Symptoms are nonspecific and similar to clinical features of neonatal bacterial infection

- Arthritis is uncommon.

- The classification of IE is the same in adults and children.

Peripheral embolic and immunologic phenomena of IE are uncommon in children. [52]

## Diagnostics [52][53]

- Initial diagnostics for IE are similar in adults and children.

- The following studies are not routinely performed in children:

- Cardiac biomarkers

- Lactic acid

- Use the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria to help predict the likelihood of IE. [52]

- Obtain diagnostics for pediatric sepsis if signs of pediatric sepsis are present (obtain diagnostics for neonatal sepsis for all neonates with fever).

- If there is diagnostic uncertainty, consult a specialist (e.g., infectious diseases) for additional studies for IE.

Blood cultures are negative in up to 5% of children with IE. [52]

## Treatment [51][52]

- Treatment of IE is similar to adults.

- Consult infectious diseases to direct antibiotic therapy; if not available, initiate empiric therapy, e.g.:  [52]

- Ampicillin/sulbactam OR vancomycin

- PLUS gentamicin

- Nosocomial endocarditis : Add a cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime OR ceftazidime).

- Prosthetic valve

- Add rifampicin.

- New valve (≤ 12 months): Also add a cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime OR ceftazidime).

- Transition to targeted antibiotic therapy based on culture and sensitivity results.

- Treatment typically lasts 4–6 weeks.  [52]

- Clinically stable patients without complications : Consider continuing IV antibiotics on an outpatient basis in consultation with infectious diseases.

In well-appearing children whose blood cultures remain negative, continue monitoring for 48 hours before starting antibiotics, to allow for additional cultures to be obtained. [52]

## Prevention [47][51]

- Prevention strategies are similar in adults and children; see “Endocarditis prophylaxis” for details.

- Encourage routine oral hygiene and dental care (see “Oral hygiene in children”). [52]
