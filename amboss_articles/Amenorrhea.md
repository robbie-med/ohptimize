### Summary

Amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation. It is classified as either primary amenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea depending on whether menarche has occurred. Causes include physiological factors (e.g., pregnancy, lactation, menopause), dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, anatomical reproductive tract abnormalities, gonadal dysfunction, and systemic diseases. Clinical evaluation involves a focused history and physical examination, including a pelvic examination, Tanner staging, and evaluation for signs of common causes of amenorrhea. All individuals with amenorrhea should be evaluated for pregnancy and, based on clinical evaluation, receive targeted testing for suspected causes. Causes of primary amenorrhea are often identified with clinical evaluation and, if indicated, pelvic ultrasound and certain laboratory studies (e.g., FSH, karyotype). Causes of secondary amenorrhea are identified using hormone testing and often a pelvic ultrasound, followed by additional testing if indicated. Management focuses on the underlying cause and may include lifestyle changes, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), surgical correction for anatomical abnormalities, and infertility treatment.

### Definitions

Amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation; it is classified as either primary amenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea.

- Primary amenorrhea: no menarche by 15 years of age or 5 years after thelarche, whichever comes first [2]

- Secondary amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation for more than: [2]

- 3 months in individuals with previously regular cycles

- 6 months in individuals with previously irregular cycles

Delayed puberty in female individuals is defined as an absence of breast development by 13 years of age, and its workup includes an evaluation for causes of primary amenorrhea. [2][3]

### Etiology

### Physiological causes [2][4][5]

- Pregnancy

- Lactation

- Menopause

Pregnancy, lactation, and menopause are the most common causes of amenorrhea. [2]

### Reproductive tract abnormalities [2][4][5]

- Transverse vaginal septum

- Imperforate hymen

- Agenesis of the lower vagina

- Pelvic examination to assess for:

- Structural abnormalities (e.g., imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, blind or absent vagina)

- Signs of low estrogen (e.g., prepubertal appearance, urogenital atrophy)  [12][13]

Hypertension may be present in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency or in patients with Cushing syndrome. [2][14]

### Diagnosis

### Approach [2][4]

Obtain a pregnancy test in all patients before initiating a diagnostic workup for amenorrhea.

## Primary amenorrhea

- Cervix visualized on pelvic examination (i.e., a uterus is present): Obtain FSH; consider also obtaining other initial laboratory studies for amenorrhea.

- FSH ↓ or normal

- Breasts absent: Evaluate for constitutional delay of growth and puberty and isolated GnRH deficiency (e.g., Kallmann syndrome).

- Breasts present: Perform workup for secondary amenorrhea.

- FSH ↑:  Perform karyotyping to evaluate for genetic causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (gonadal dysgenesis).

- Blind or absent vagina on pelvic examination: Perform pelvic ultrasound to assess internal reproductive organs.

- Uterus absent: Perform karyotyping and measure testosterone level.

- Uterus present: Consider ; congenital reproductive outflow tract obstruction (e.g., imperforate hymen, vaginal agenesis, and transverse vaginal septum).

- See “Common causes of primary amenorrhea” for further details on interpretation of findings.

## Secondary amenorrhea

- Obtain:

- Initial laboratory studies for amenorrhea

- Targeted testing for amenorrhea as clinically indicated

- Pelvic ultrasound, if readily available

- See “Common causes of secondary amenorrhea” for further details on interpretation of findings.

- If no cause is identified, consider hormone withdrawal testing for amenorrhea.

### Initial laboratory studies for amenorrhea [2][4]

Tests commonly obtained include the following:

- FSH with or without LH

- Estradiol with or without anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)

- TSH

- Prolactin

### Targeted testing for amenorrhea [2][4]

Obtain targeted testing as indicated by clinical presentation, if not already obtained as part of initial testing.

- Laboratory studies

- Signs of estrogen deficiency: FSH, LH, estradiol, AMH

- Signs of hyperandrogenism: free and total testosterone, DHEA-S, 17-hydroxyprogesterone

- Signs of hyperprolactinemia (e.g., galactorrhea): prolactin

- Signs of hypothyroidism or signs of hyperthyroidism: TSH

- Signs of adrenal insufficiency or hypercortisolism: cortisol

- Signs of chronic systemic illness: CBC, BMP, ESR, CRP, urinalysis

- Weight loss and/or gastrointestinal symptoms: diagnostics for celiac disease

- Imaging

- Suspected PCOS and/or structural reproductive tract abnormalities: pelvic ultrasound or MRI

- Suspected androgen-secreting tumor: adrenal imaging

- Symptoms suggestive of CNS pathology (e.g., visual field defects) and/or persistent hyperprolactinemia: MRI brain

↑ TSH suggests hypothyroidism as a cause of amenorrhea.
Elevated levels of androgens (testosterone, DHEA-S) can be seen with PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome, or an androgen-secreting tumor. [4]

## Hormone withdrawal testing in amenorrhea [15]

The following studies can be used to evaluate patients with secondary amenorrhea if there is no identified cause after the initial workup.  [2]

- Progestin challenge test: typically the initial test

- Method: Administer a progestin for 5–10 days. [16]

- Interpretation: Assess for withdrawal bleeding within 14 days of progestin cessation.

- Withdrawal bleeding: indicates anovulation (e.g., PCOS, idiopathic anovulation)

- No withdrawal bleeding: indicates hypoestrogenism (i.e., hypogonadism) or reproductive outflow tract obstruction

- Estrogen-progesterone challenge test: performed in patients with no withdrawal bleeding on initial testing

- Method

- Administer estrogen for 21–25 days.

- Add progesterone during the last 5–10 days of estrogen administration.

- Interpretation: Assess for withdrawal bleeding within 2–7 days of progesterone cessation.

- Withdrawal bleeding:  indicates hypoestrogenism (i.e., hypogonadism)

- No withdrawal bleeding:  indicates reproductive outflow tract obstruction or endometrial dysfunction (e.g., Asherman syndrome; , endometritis)
