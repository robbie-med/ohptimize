# Examination of the eye

### Summary

The evaluation of the eyes is an essential component of the physical examination. There are two types of eye examinations, basic and comprehensive. This article focuses on the comprehensive eye examination, a series of at least twelve tests to screen and diagnose common eye disorders. It should be performed on patients with ophthalmologic symptoms and annually on all individuals ≥ 40 years of age. Tests typically include evaluation of visual acuity, visual fields, the external eye structure (orbit, eyebrows, eyelids and margins, palpebral aperture, lacrimal apparatus, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea), the anterior ocular chamber (iris, lens, pupils), ocular movements, and the optic fundus. Adjunct tests and procedures may be indicated depending on the findings of the initial exam.
For more information on the basic eye examination, see “Head and neck examination.”

- Direct ophthalmoscopy (direct fundoscopy) [11]

- The examiner looks through a handheld device with its own light source and lens to visualize the fundus.

- Produces an upright (noninverted) image of the retina

- Indirect ophthalmoscopy (indirect fundoscopy): magnified and wider view compared to direct ophthalmoscopy [12]

- Monocular: The examiner shines a forehead-mounted light into the eye and visualizes the fundus through a handheld lens, producing an inverted view.

- Binocular: The examiner looks through a forehead-mounted device with its own light source, two lenses, and mirror system, producing a stereoscopic view.

### Indications

- Routine ophthalmologic evaluation: visualization of the posterior retinal structures

- Retinal detachment

- Glaucoma

- Diagnosis of conditions related to chronic disorders (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus)

### Procedure for direct ophthalmoscopy

- Room lights are dimmed or off.

- The ophthalmoscope's lens disc is switched to 0 diopters.

- The ophthalmoscope is positioned ∼ 15 inches away from the examinee and slightly lateral to their line of vision.

- Ask the examinee to fix their gaze at a point on the wall.

- When examining the right eye, the examiner should hold the ophthalmoscope in their right hand and look through their right eye (and vice versa).

- While keeping the ophthalmoscope fixed on the pupil, move the device towards the examinee's eye until almost touching the eyelids.

### Components and findings

- Red reflex: an eye test that assesses the light reflection of the ocular fundus, which normally has a red color

- Normal findings: red colored reflection

- Abnormal findings: absence of red reflex

- In children: may indicate congenital cataracts or retinoblastoma

- In adults: may be caused by cataracts or a detached retina

- Inspection of the anterior eye segment

- Assessment of the fundus

- Optic disc (contour, color, cup)

- Retina (Red reflex assessment), retinal vessels (clockwise assessment superior temporal, nasal, and inferior nasal and temporal)

- Macula and fovea

- Periphery of the fundus

| Optic disc | Located on the nasal side of the macula  Characteristics to assess (the three Cs) Contour: should be clear and well defined Color: should be yellow-pink Cup: pale center within the optic disc that should occupy ⅓ of the optic disc size | A blurred, swollen disc: papilledema  An enlarged cup: chronic open-angle glaucoma  A pale optic disc: optic atrophy |
| Retina and retinal vessels | Arteries appear as light red and smaller than veins, which appear as dark red. Most patients have spontaneous venous pulsations. | Arteriolar narrowing (copper/silver wire appearance): hypertensive retinopathy Pale patches (cotton wool spots): hypertensive retinopathy Hemorrhages (flame or blot hemorrhages): hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy  Loss of these pulsations: intracranial hypertension or glaucoma |
| Macula and fovea | The macula is located temporally to the optic nerve and has a yellow color. The fovea is located in the center of the macula and is dark-yellow color. | A “cherry red spot” at the fovea: central retinal artery occlusion  Pale discoloration of the macula may suggest macular degeneration, especially in elderly individuals. |
| Periphery of the fundus | Pink or red color, smooth | Tearing, lesions, hyperpigmentation |

Mydriatic drops are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma because they can induce an acute angle closure glaucoma.
