### Edition 138 - December 20, 2025

### Holiday edition: Santa, gifts, and hot water bottles

## The GRINCH Index

Instead of Press Ganey surveys, this study used a more festive metric of patient satisfaction: the number of Christmas presents given to dermatologists. In a national survey in Italy, 50 clinicians logged 659 gifts to generate the GRINCH Index, a holiday-themed score of gratitude in action. The GRINCH Index climbed with experience, with seasoned dermatologists receiving the most gifts; male doctors edged out female doctors, and patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne) were the most generous. Private-practice clinicians scored lowest, likely because patients already pay out of pocket. All gifts stayed within ethical limits, and in the end, holiday gratitude was best captured by the GRINCH Index’s tally of cioccolatini, vino, e ringraziamenti.

## Spoiled kids, heavier sacks, and a dangerously wobbly Santa

With children’s wish lists getting longer and heavier every year, carrying Santa’s gift sack now rivals a kettlebell workout, so researchers set out to see whether these generous demands are putting him at real fall risk. To simulate risks for falls in older adults, volunteers donned full Santa gear and lugged a 20-kg sack while walking, balancing, and multitasking, mimicking Santa checking his list (twice!) mid-route. And with a pile of presents worthy of Veruca Salt, the findings weren’t surprising: The suit and heavy load threw off gait and balance, and performing a cognitive task made everything even wobblier. Moral of the story: Unless Santa starts pre-holiday strength and balance training, spoiled-kid wish lists might make Christmas literally fall apart.

- Original study: Jeopardizing Christmas: why spoiled kids and a tight schedule could make Santa Claus fall? [2]

## Hot water bottles and accidental holiday sizzle

As temperatures drop, hot water bottles become winter’s comfort...but a 10-year analysis showed that they also trigger a steady stream of burn injuries. Most injuries occurred in women, typically as second-degree burns on the lower abdomen and thighs. Surprisingly, the European energy crisis didn’t drive a spike in burns: Neither reduced gas consumption due to soaring prices nor waves of respiratory infections predicted burn rates. Only ambient temperature mattered: Each 1°C increase cut the risk by about 7%. When winter bites, heat-seeking habits (not economic hardship) fuel these easily preventable injuries. Cozy up carefully this holiday season.

### Edition 137 - December 6, 2025

### Taking the headache out of the headlines: acetaminophen cleared of autism risk

One-Minute Telegram 137-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Acetaminophen is a preferred analgesic and antipyretic in pregnancy, but conflicting observational data have raised concerns about links to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring exposed in utero. This umbrella review evaluated nine systematic reviews on prenatal acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes and found that studies reporting an association failed to adequately control for confounding and address other potential sources of bias. In contrast, sibling-controlled studies, which account for genetics and home environment, showed no association between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders. These data indicate that the link between neurodevelopmental disorders and acetaminophen was likely never about the drug, but rather the shared genetic and environmental factors of affected families.

## Study breakdown

- Evidence base: 9 systematic reviews encompassing 40 primary studies (37 prospective cohorts, 2 case-control, 1 ecological) of pregnant individuals and their offspring

- Study design: umbrella review

- Setting: included studies from Europe, North America, Asia, Brazil, and New Zealand

- Exposure: acetaminophen use during pregnancy

- Outcomes

- Diagnosis of ASD or ADHD in offspring

- Methodological quality of included reviews assessed using AMSTAR 2 criteria

- Follow-up: varied across the primary studies

- Main findings

- All nine systematic reviews (including four meta-analyses) found a possible to strong association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ASD and/or ADHD in offspring.

- However, the confidence in their findings was rated as "critically low" for seven reviews and "low" for two due to ≥ 1 critical weakness in their study design.

- Across the systematic reviews included, the degree of overlap of primary studies was high (23% corrected covered area).

- 38 of the 40 primary studies included in the reviews did not adjust for unmeasured familial confounders.

- 2 primary studies, including > 2 million offspring, 249,160 discordantly exposed siblings, and 380 discordantly exposed families, assessed whole-cohort vs. sibling-controlled risk for ASD (1 study) and ADHD (both studies).

- Whole-cohort analyses: Small increased risks were observed for both ASD (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08) and ADHD (1.07; 1.05–1.10 and 2.02; 1.17–3.25).

- Sibling-controlled analyses: These associations were no longer observed for either ASD (0.98; 0.93–1.04) or ADHD (0.98; 0.94–1.02 and 1.06; 0.51–2.05).

- Limitations include:

- Authors of the systematic reviews included were not contacted for additional information.

- Potential for exposure misclassification (recall bias) in primary studies relying on self-reporting

- Sibling analyses are susceptible to confounding by unshared exposures (e.g., maternal stress or infection affecting only one pregnancy).

- In one primary study, a quarter of the sibling sample was excluded from analysis due to missing information.

- Study funding: Some authors received funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, and European Social Fund Plus.

- Original study: Maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: umbrella review of systematic reviews [4]

- Related AMBOSS articles: Autism spectrum disorder; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

## Discussion points

- Study design: What is the primary advantage of an umbrella review over a standard systematic review?

- Study methods: Why are sibling-controlled analyses particularly important when studying neurodevelopmental outcomes such as ADHD and ASD?

- Clinical application: How should this study influence counseling a pregnant patient with a high fever who is hesitant to take acetaminophen?

### Funding freeze: NIH grant terminations disrupt clinical research

One-Minute Telegram 137-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Clinical trials are essential for evaluating medical interventions and require sustained financial support. Recent Trump administration policies have led to abrupt cuts in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for active trials. This cross-sectional study analyzed 11,008 NIH-funded trials and found that 3.5% of trials, involving over 74,000 participants, had their grants terminated in 2025, disproportionately affecting research in infectious diseases, preventive medicine, and behavioral interventions. These disruptions raise significant concerns over research ethics, waste of resources, and violation of the pact made with participating patients to advance medical knowledge.

## Study breakdown

- Evidence base: 11,008 NIH-funded interventional clinical trials active as of February 28, 2025

- Study design: cross-sectional study

- Setting: US and international research funded by the US NIH (identified via NIH ExPORTER)

- Exposure: termination of NIH grant funding (identified via the US Department of Health and Human Services Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System)

- Outcomes

- Primary: proportion of trials with terminated funding

- Secondary: trial characteristics (e.g., status, enrollment, location, purpose, condition)

- Follow-up: February 28 to August 15, 2025

- Main results

- Overall impact

- 383 of 11,008 trials (3.5%) lost grant funding.

- Of these, 36% were completed, 11% were active and not recruiting, 38% were recruiting or enrolling by invitation, and 14% were not yet recruiting.

- At the time of termination, 74,311 participants may have been receiving trial-related interventions.

- Trials conducted outside the US were more likely to be terminated (5.8% vs. 3.4%; P = 0.009).

- Termination rates were significantly higher in trials involving infectious diseases (14.4%), prevention (8.4%), health services (5.4%), and behavioral interventions (5.0%).

- Limitations:

- Reasons for grant terminations were unknown.

- Reliance on investigator-reported data, which may be subject to reporting lags or inaccuracies

- Inability to compare with prior trends in grant terminations due to a lack of historical data

- The cross-sectional design provides a snapshot but does not capture the long-term fate of the affected trials (e.g., whether alternative funding was secured).

- Study funding: none reported

- Original study: Clinical trials affected by research grant terminations at the National Institutes of Health [5]

### It's ICU cuffing season with noninvasive blood pressure monitoring

One-Minute Telegram 137-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Arterial catheters are currently recommended for continuous blood pressure monitoring in patients with shock, but they carry procedural risks. [6][7] This multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial involving 1010 ICU patients with shock found that, based on 28-day mortality, cuff-based noninvasive blood pressure monitoring was noninferior to early arterial catheter insertion. These findings suggest that noninvasive blood pressure monitoring may safely replace invasive monitoring in most patients with shock.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1010 adults with shock within 24 hours of ICU admission

- > 50% with septic shock

- Mean age, 66 years; ∼ 32% female; mean SOFA score, 10

- Study design: multicenter, open-label, noninferiority, 1:1 randomized controlled trial (EVERDAC trial)

- Setting: nine ICUs in France

- Intervention

- Noninvasive strategy: blood pressure monitoring with an automated brachial cuff

- Invasive strategy: blood pressure monitoring with an arterial catheter inserted ≤ 4 hours after randomization

- Outcomes

- Primary: all-cause mortality at day 28

- Secondary: 90-day mortality, change in disease severity measures, arterial punctures, adverse events

- Follow-up: 90 days

- Main results

- 28-day mortality (intention-to-treat analysis) was similar in both groups.

- Noninvasive strategy: 34.3%

- Invasive strategy: 36.9%

- Adjusted risk difference, -3.2% (95% CI, -8.9% to 2.5%); within noninferiority margin of 5% (P = 0.006)

- Secondary outcomes

- No significant difference in 90-day mortality, change in SOFA score, or days free from vasopressors or ventilators

- In the noninvasive group, 14.7% of patients eventually underwent arterial catheter insertion.

- Patients in the noninvasive group reported more pain and/or discomfort (22.8% vs. 15.4%; difference, 7.5%; 95% CI, 0.0 to 13.9) and received more arterial punctures for blood sampling (incidence ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.41 to 3.16).

- Catheter-related complications (e.g., hematoma, catheter-related bloodstream infections) were significantly lower in the noninvasive group.

- Limitations include:

- The open-label design may have introduced performance bias and observer bias.

- A significant number of potentially eligible patients were not screened or were excluded without explanation, raising concern for selection bias.

- Pregnant patients, those with BMI > 40, severe traumatic brain injury, or already on high-dose vasopressors (> 2.5 mcg/kg/minute of norepinephrine equivalent) were excluded, limiting generalizability.

- Pain and discomfort were only measured in patients who were awake and able to report symptoms.

- Pain associated with arterial puncture for blood sampling was not assessed.

- Results may not be generalizable to centers that use advanced noninvasive continuous monitoring (e.g., volume clamp methods) rather than intermittent cuffs.

### Edition 136 - November 22, 2025

### Capillary refill time gets personal in septic shock

One-Minute Telegram 136-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

In septic shock, early optimization of tissue perfusion is lifesaving but challenging. This international randomized clinical trial found that personalized hemodynamic resuscitation targeting capillary refill time (CRT-PHR) within 6 hours of septic shock onset improved the composite outcome of mortality, duration of vital support, and length of hospital stay at 28 days compared to usual care. CRT-guided resuscitation in critical care may allow for real-time, individualized adjustments in the management of early septic shock.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1467 adults with early septic shock (mean age, 66 years; 43% women) from 86 locations in 19 countries

- Study design: randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial

- Setting: clinical sites in the Americas, Europe, and Asia (March 2022 to April 2025)

- Intervention: randomized 1:1

- CRT-PHR: administration of fluids, vasopressors, and/or inotropes over 6 hours according to a prespecified protocol targeting CRT normalization (n = 720)

- Usual care: per local or international sepsis guidelines (n = 747)

- Primary outcome

- Hierarchical composite outcome of all-cause mortality, duration of vital support (i.e., vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy), and length of hospital stay at 28 days

- Analyzed using the win ratio method, stratified by APACHE II score at admission

- Secondary outcomes (at 28 days): all-cause mortality, vital support-free days, and length of hospital stay

- Follow-up: 90 days

- Main results

- CRT-PHR was superior to usual care for the composite hierarchical outcome.

- CRT-PHR: 131,131 wins (48.9%)

- Usual care: 112,787 wins (42.1%)

- Stratified win ratio: 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.33)

- Individual wins in the CRT-PHR vs. usual care groups

- All-cause mortality: 19.1% vs. 17.8%

- Duration of vital support: 26.4% vs. 21.1%

- Length of hospital stay: 3.4% vs. 3.2%

- Secondary outcomes in the CRT-PHR vs. usual care groups

- Similar all-cause mortality: 26.5% vs. 26.6% (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.21)

- More vital support-free days: 16.5 ± 11.3 vs. 15.4 ± 11.4 (proportional OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.54)

- Similar mean length of hospital stay: 15.3 ± 9.0 vs. 16.2 ± 9.4 (mean difference, -0.85; 95% CI, -1.80 to 0.10)

- Limitations include:

- Open-label design increases the risk of systematic errors.

- Decisions on vital support provision and discontinuation were not standardized, increasing the risk for random error.

- Possible variability in CRT measurement between clinicians

- Protocol complexity may limit implementation.

## Discussion points

- Study design: What advantages does a hierarchical composite endpoint with win ratio analysis offer in critical care trials?

- Study methods: How does targeting CRT differ from other sepsis resuscitation strategies (e.g., lactate-guided)?

- Clinical application: Should clinicians adopt CRT-guided personalized resuscitation protocols in early septic shock?

### A whiff of prevention: azelastine nasal spray and COVID-19 risk

One-Minute Telegram 136-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Azelastine nasal spray (an accessible, over-the-counter treatment for allergic rhinitis) shows antiviral activity against respiratory viruses in vitro and may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Germany, there were significantly fewer PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections after 56 days of azelastine compared to placebo. Although encouraging, this single-center study needs confirmation before changing practice.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 450 healthy adults (mean age, 33 years; 66% women; 92.7% White; 99.1% received ≥ 1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine)

- Study design: phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: Saarland University Hospital, Germany (March 2023 to July 2024)

- Intervention: randomized 1:1

- Azelastine 0.1% nasal spray 1 puff/nostril 3 times a day for 56 days (n = 227)

- Placebo spray (n = 223)

- Primary outcome: PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection

- Rapid antigen tests were performed twice weekly and confirmed with PCR if positive.

- Analysis: intention-to-treat

- Secondary outcomes: symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, time to infection, duration of test positivity, other upper respiratory tract infections, adverse events

- Follow-up: 56 days

- Main results

- Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower with azelastine vs. placebo.

- Azelastine: 5 infections (2.2%)

- Placebo: 15 infections (6.7%)

- OR: 0.31 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.87)

- Compared to the placebo group, the azelastine group had:

- Fewer symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: 1.8% vs. 6.3% (risk difference, -4.5%; 95% CI, -8.1 to -0.9%)

- Longer time to infection with SARS-CoV-2: 31.2 vs. 19.5 days (mean difference, 11.7 days; 95% CI, 9.5 to 14.0 days)

- Shorter duration of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity: 3.4 vs. 5.14 days (mean difference, -1.74 days; -2.17 to -1.31 days)

- Fewer overall PCR-confirmed respiratory infections: 9.3% vs. 22.0%

- Adverse events were similar in both groups, but there were more treatment-related adverse events in the azelastine group.

- No serious treatment-related adverse events

- Higher incidence of treatment-related bitter taste (9.3% vs. 1.3%), nosebleeds (6.6% vs. 4.0%), and tiredness (3.1% vs. 0%) in the azelastine group vs. the placebo group

- Limitations include:

- The study was conducted in a mostly healthy, vaccinated population in a single center, which limits generalizability.

- Possible unblinding due to bitter taste

- The placebo formulation may have had a minor protective effect.

### Long game, small (survival) gain after 23 years of PSA screening

One-Minute Telegram 136-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening remains highly controversial. This update of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) found lower prostate cancer mortality in participants who were offered PSA screening (1.4%) compared to those not offered screening (1.6%), representing a 13% relative risk reduction. These long-term data demonstrate a real but modest reduction in mortality that must be weighed against the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 162,236 men aged 55–69 years (median age, 60 years) from 7 European countries

- Study design: randomized, multicenter trial (ERSPC)

- Setting: centers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland (1993–2020)

- Intervention: randomized 1:1 (∼ 1:5 in Finland)

- Screening (n = 72,888): invited for PSA testing every 2–7 years (typically every 4 years), with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy if levels exceeded 3–4 ng/mL

- Control (n = 89,348): not invited for screening

- Primary outcome: prostate cancer-specific mortality

- Secondary outcome: prostate cancer incidence, stratified by risk category

- Median follow-up: 23 years

- Main results

- Prostate cancer mortality

- 1.4% in the screening group vs. 1.6% in the control group (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.95)

- Absolute risk reduction: 0.22% (95% CI, 0.10–0.34) at 23 years' follow-up

- Number needed to invite to prevent one prostate cancer death: 456 (306–943)

- Number needed to diagnose to prevent one prostate cancer death: 12 (8–26)

- Cumulative prostate cancer incidence

- 14% in the screening group vs. 12% in the control group (risk ratio, 1.30; 1.26–1.33)

- Incidence of low-risk cancer was twice as high in the screening group vs. the control group.

- Incidence of advanced cancer was 3–4 times lower in the screening group vs. the control group.

- Limitations include:

- Variation in screening intervals and biopsy thresholds across centers

- Participants in the control group may have had PSA testing outside of the study.

- Exclusion of lower-quality data from study sites in France reduces generalizability.

- Lack of adjustment for current diagnostic methods (e.g., MRI, risk calculators) may limit real-world applicability.

### Edition 135 - November 8, 2025

### Colchicine comes up short for long COVID

One-Minute Telegram 135-2025-1/1

## 10-second takeaway

Long COVID manifests with persistent symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection, likely mediated by ongoing inflammation. In this double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, colchicine did not improve functional capacity at 52 weeks in adults with long COVID compared to placebo. These results highlight the continued need for research on effective treatments for long COVID.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 346 adults (mean age, 46 years; 60% women) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent functional limitations (Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale ≥ 2) and/or elevated markers of inflammation (high sensitivity CRP > 0.20 mg/dL or neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 5) ≥ 22 days after infection

- Study design: multicenter, superiority, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial

- Setting: 8 hospitals across 6 Indian states between January 2022 and July 2023

- Intervention: colchicine 0.5 mg once or twice daily depending on body weight (≤ 70 kg or > 70 kg) for 26 weeks vs. placebo

- Primary outcome: change in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance in meters from baseline to 52 weeks

- Secondary outcomes included changes in inflammatory markers, quality of life, anxiety, depression, dyspnea, fatigue, and pulmonary function tests.

- Follow-up: 12, 26, and 52 weeks after randomization

- Main results

- No superiority in 6MWT distance at 52 weeks

- Colchicine: 35.55 m (SD ± 19.76 m)

- Placebo: 29.96 m (± 19.83 m)

- Mean difference: 5.59 m (95% CI, -9.00 to 20.18 m)

- Slight, nonclinically relevant difference in FEV₁/FVC ratio favoring colchicine: mean difference, 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07)

- No superiority in other secondary outcomes

- Similar rates of adverse events in the colchicine and placebo groups (19.9 vs. 17.6%); 2 deaths in the colchicine group (unrelated)

- Most common adverse events included finger/toe tingling and joint or muscle symptoms

- Compliance (adherence to ≥ 80% of the medication regimen) was similar in both groups (∼ 76%).

- Limitations include:

- Single-country setting resulted in decreased racial and ethnic diversity, limiting generalizability.

- Broad inclusion criteria likely introduced heterogeneity across long COVID presentations, which may have reduced the study’s ability to detect true differences (i.e., type II error).

- Possible underpowering to detect small functional improvements

- Study funding: Indian Council of Medical Research

- Original study: Effectiveness of colchicine for the treatment of long COVID [12]

- Related AMBOSS articles: COVID-19

## Discussion points

- Study design: Why is double-blinding important in a symptom-driven condition such as long COVID?

- Study methods: Are there any limitations to choosing the 6MWT as a functional measure for the primary endpoint?

- Clinical application: Should clinicians use colchicine for long COVID?

### Edition 134 - October 25, 2025

### Physician, heal thyself: attrition from clinical practice is on the rise

One-Minute Telegram 134-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

The voluntary departure of physicians from clinical practice exacerbates current staff shortages and further threatens the US health care system. Unfortunately, efforts to mitigate this attrition are hampered by a lack of actionable data. In this nationwide, longitudinal study from 2013 to 2019, the rate of physicians leaving clinical practice increased significantly in all specialties, locations, and demographic groups but was most pronounced in female physicians, rural physicians, and those caring for older patients with complex medical conditions. Understanding which physician groups have the highest rates of attrition will help inform the design of targeted interventions to sustain the physician workforce.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 712,395 physicians providing care to Medicare patients between 2013 and 2022 (median age, 50 years; 70.8% male; 90.8% in urban settings; physician race/ethnicity not reported)

- Study design: longitudinal cohort study

- Setting: all clinical settings in the US

- Exposure

- Years of clinical practice

- Physician characteristics (e.g., sex, specialty, rural vs. urban location)

- Patient characteristics (e.g., age, health risk score, dual insurance eligibility)

- Outcome: attrition from clinical practice, defined as billing for < 50 Medicare evaluation and management (E&M) services for ≥ 3 consecutive years

- Follow-up: 9 years

- Main results

- Overall attrition rate

- 2013: 3.5%

- 2019: 4.9%

- Unadjusted rate difference (RD), 1.4% (95% CI, 1.3–1.4%)

- Attrition rates increased significantly from 2013 to 2019 across all physician subgroups.

- Sex: 3.6% to 5.1% (RD, 1.5%; 1.4–1.7%) in female physicians and 3.5% to 4.8% (RD, 1.3%; 1.2–1.4%) in male physicians

- Setting: 4.3% to 6.2% (RD, 1.9%; 1.6–2.2%) in rural settings and 3.4% to 4.7% (RD, 1.3%; 1.3–1.4%) in urban settings

- For specialty and age, the increase in attrition rate was highest in OB/GYN physicians and physicians aged > 65 years, respectively.

- In multivariable models, factors associated with a higher risk of attrition were:

- Female sex

- Rural practice

- Practice outside the Northeast

- Caring for older patients and/or patients with a high risk score

- Patient panels with a higher proportion of dual Medicare/Medicaid eligibility

- Factors associated with a lower risk of attrition were:

- Surgical specialty: HR, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.58–0.61)

- Medical specialty: HR, 0.67 (0.65–0.68)

- Caring for patient panels with higher proportions of Black, Hispanic, or other non-White patients

- Limitations include:

- The analysis relied on Medicare fee-for-service claims and therefore does not capture physicians who do not care for Medicare patients (e.g., pediatricians) or whose entire practice is outside this payment model.

- The definition of attrition could misclassify physicians who reduced their clinical hours but continued to practice.

- The primary analysis concluded in 2019, so it does not capture changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The data cannot distinguish between physicians who left clinical practice entirely and those who moved into nonclinical roles such as administration or research.

## Discussion points

- Study design: This was an observational study using a large administrative database. What are the main strengths and weaknesses of this approach for studying physician attrition?

- Study methods: The authors defined attrition as billing fewer than 50 E&M services for ≥ 3 consecutive years. How might this definition affect the results, and why was it chosen?

- Study application: The study found that physicians caring for older, medically complex, and dual-eligible patients had higher rates of attrition. What practical interventions could health systems implement to support these physicians?

### Are MDIs a breath of fresh air? Not for the climate

One-Minute Telegram 134-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are the cornerstone of managing respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their potent greenhouse gas propellants contribute to global pollution. In this serial cross-sectional study analyzing US outpatient pharmacy data from 2014 to 2024, researchers found that inhalers added 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO₂e) to the environment, which equates to the same annual emissions as 530,000 gas-powered cars. MDIs were responsible for 98% of all emissions caused by inhalers. These findings highlight a major opportunity for clinicians to reduce health care's carbon footprint by preferentially prescribing more environmentally friendly dry powder or soft mist inhalers when clinically appropriate.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: data corresponding to 1.6 billion inhalers dispensed for asthma or COPD in the US between 2014 and 2024

- Study design: serial cross-sectional analysis

- Setting: US outpatient pharmaceutical market (using the Symphony Health Metys database)

- Exposure: inhaler device type (MDI, dry powder inhaler, or soft mist inhaler) and number dispensed

- Outcome: estimated greenhouse gas emissions, measured in mtCO₂e, and associated social costs

- Follow-up: 10 years

- Main results

- From 2014 to 2024:

- Inhalers generated 24.9 million mtCO₂e

- Emissions increased by 24%, from 1.9 million mtCO₂e in 2014 to 2.3 million mtCO₂e in 2024.

- The estimated social cost of emissions was $5.7 billion (95% CI, $3.5–10.0 billion).

- MDIs were responsible for 98% of all emissions.

- Albuterol MDIs, the largest single contributor, accounted for 72% of all emissions.

- Mean emissions intensity was highest for MDIs.

- MDIs: 22.1 kg of CO₂e per inhaler

- Dry powder inhalers: 0.8 kg of CO₂e per inhaler

- Soft mist inhalers: 0.7 kg of CO₂e per inhaler

- Limitations include:

- The analysis excluded inhalers used in inpatient settings or by military or veteran populations.

- Emissions calculations were based on propellant release and did not account for the product's full life cycle (e.g., manufacturing, transport, disposal).

- The findings are specific to the US market and may not be generalizable to countries with different prescribing patterns.

### Private equity: a hostile takeover of health?

One-Minute Telegram 134-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Private equity firms have acquired hundreds of US hospitals, raising concerns about the impact of their business model on patient care and the health care system. This matched difference-in-differences study of Medicare patients in US hospitals from 2009 to 2019 found that hospitals acquired by private equity groups had lower emergency department (ED) and ICU staffing expenditures, increased ED mortality, and increased ICU transfers compared to control hospitals. These findings suggest that cost-cutting measures following private equity takeovers, particularly staffing reductions in acute care settings, may compromise patient safety and lead to worse clinical outcomes.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 49 private equity-acquired hospitals (including 1,007,529 ED visits and 121,080 ICU hospitalizations) and 293 matched nonacquired control hospitals (including 6,179,854 ED visits and 760,377 ICU hospitalizations) in the US

- Study design: matched difference-in-differences analysis

- Setting: US hospitals with an ED, ICU, or both

- Exposure: hospital acquisition by a private equity firm

- Outcomes (compared to the previous 3 years)

- Changes in hospital staffing expenditures: ED, ICU, total hospital salary expenditures

- Changes in patient outcomes: patient mortality in the ED and ICU, transfers to other acute care hospitals, length of ICU stay

- Follow-up: 3 years after acquisition

- Main results

- Staffing expenditures were lower in hospitals acquired by private equity than in control hospitals.

- 12% fewer full-time employees: AD, -1.6 employees (95% CI, -2.5 to -0.7 employees)

- 16% lower total salary expenditures: AD, -$176 (-$233 to -$119)

- 18% lower ED salary expenditures per inpatient bed day: AD, -$12.63 (-$22.74 to -$2.52)

- 16% lower ICU salary expenditures per inpatient bed day: AD, -$8.46 (-$13.21 to -$3.72)

- ED mortality and patient transfers were higher in acquired hospitals compared to controls.

- 13% higher ED mortality: AD, 7.0 deaths/10,000 visits (1.8 to 12.3 deaths/10,000 visits)

- 4% higher ED transfers to other hospitals: AD, 0.11% (0.04 to 0.18%)

- ICU transfers were 11% higher in acquired hospitals compared to controls: AD, 0.47% (0.18 to 0.74%).

- ICU mortality was similar in both groups.

- Length of ICU stay was 5% lower in acquired hospitals compared to controls: AD, -0.2 days (-0.26 to -0.13 days).

- Limitations include:

- The study was limited to Medicare beneficiaries and may not be generalizable to other patient populations.

- The sample of acquired hospitals may not be representative of all private equity acquisitions.

- As an observational study, the results do not imply causation and could be influenced by unmeasured confounding factors.

- Salary expenditures were used as a proxy for staffing levels, as direct ED and ICU employee counts were not available.

### Edition 133 - October 11, 2025

### Rest assured: CBT-I is effective for insomnia in chronic disease

One-Minute Telegram 133-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Insomnia is a common contributor to poor disease outcomes and quality of life in patients with chronic diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 67 randomized clinical trials found that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in patients with chronic disease led to significant improvements in insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency. These findings suggest that CBT-I is an effective and acceptable first-line treatment for insomnia, even in patients with chronic medical conditions. Further research is needed to assess the effect of CBT-I on chronic disease outcomes.

## Study breakdown

- Study population

- 5232 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with comorbid chronic disease and insomnia

- Most studies included participants with cancer (27%), chronic pain (25%), traumatic brain injury (9%), cardiovascular disease (7%), or renal disease (7%).

- Study design: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

- Setting: multinational, with most studies (54%) conducted in the US

- Intervention: CBT-I vs. control

- Control groups were classified as:

- Inactive (no contact or sleep education)

- Active (some contact or sleep education)

- Matched active (equivalent time with a therapist)

- Primary outcomes

- Insomnia severity (self-reported Insomnia Severity Index score)

- Sleep efficiency (self-reported or objectively measured percentage of time spent in bed asleep)

- Sleep onset latency (self-reported or objectively measured time to fall asleep)

- Secondary outcomes included:

- Treatment acceptability (e.g., treatment satisfaction)

- Adverse effects

- Main results

- Compared with controls, CBT-I was associated with significant improvements in:

- Insomnia severity, with a large effect size: Hedges’ g, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.81–1.16)

- Sleep efficiency, with a moderate effect size: g, 0.77 (0.63–0.91)

- Sleep onset latency, with a moderate effect size: g, 0.64 (0.50–0.78)

- For both insomnia severity and sleep efficacy, effect sizes were higher when CBT-I was compared to inactive controls vs. active controls.

- Efficacy was similar for different chronic diseases and for digital and face-to-face CBT-I.

- Acceptability of CBT-I was high (mean dropout rate, 12.7%).

- Treatment-related adverse effects were rare.

- Limitations include:

- High methodological heterogeneity among the included studies

- Evidence of publication bias: Smaller studies with nonsignificant results or results that do not support the efficacy of CBT-I are likely missing from the literature.

- Across studies, methods for identifying insomnia and chronic disease differed (e.g., objective assessments, self-reported measures), increasing the potential for misclassification bias.

- Study funding: The lead author was supported by a Macquarie University Research Fellowship.

## Discussion points

- Study design: What are the primary strengths and weaknesses of using a systematic review and meta-analysis to answer this clinical question?

- Study methods: The study found that the effect of CBT-I was higher when compared to inactive controls vs. active controls. What does this tell us about the efficacy of the intervention? s.

- Clinical application: The review found no significant difference in efficacy between digital and face-to-face CBT-I. What are the clinical implications of this finding for treating insomnia in patients with chronic disease?

### PPV23 may miss the mark for ASCVD prevention

One-Minute Telegram 133-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Animal studies and meta-analyses of observational data in humans have suggested that the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine protects against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This large randomized trial in Australia found that the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) did not reduce the risk of heart attack or ischemic stroke compared to placebo, although the study was underpowered due to a lower than expected event rate. These findings challenge the cardioprotective hypothesis and indicate the need for larger-scale studies to definitively assess the impact of PPV23 on ASCVD risk.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 4725 community-dwelling adults aged 55–60 years with ≥ 2 cardiovascular risk factors and no prior cardiovascular disease (mean age, 58 years; 52% male)

- Study design: double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm randomized clinical trial

- Setting: 6 recruiting centers across Australia

- Intervention: single intramuscular injection of PPV23 vs. saline placebo

- Primary outcome: composite of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, assessed via ICD-10 codes in EMRs

- Secondary outcomes included surrogate markers for ASCVD (e.g., oxidized LDL antibodies).

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 7.0 years

- There was no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between the PPV23 and placebo groups.

- PPV23: 58 events

- Placebo: 64 events

- HR, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.63–1.28)

- There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes.

- Limitations include:

- The study was underpowered because the cardiovascular event rate was significantly lower than anticipated.

- The trial did not achieve its original recruitment target.

- High-risk individuals with an indication for PPV23, such as smoking or diabetes, were excluded from the study.

- The participants were relatively young (55–60 years of age), which likely contributed to the low event rate.

### Hormone therapy for hot flashes: a heart-to-heart on risks by age

One-Minute Telegram 133-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective for vasomotor symptoms of menopause (VMS), but its cardiovascular risks are a major concern. In this secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials, HRT did not increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in women aged 50–59 years with VMS, but it was associated with a significant increase in risk in those aged ≥ 70 years. These findings support initiating HRT for moderate or severe VMS in younger postmenopausal women but suggest it should be avoided in women ≥ 70 years of age due to potential cardiovascular harm.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years (mean age, 63.4 years) from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trials

- Study design: secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials

- Setting: 40 clinical centers in the US between November 1993 and September 2012

- Intervention

- Women after hysterectomy: conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg/day vs. placebo

- Women with a uterus: CEE 0.625 mg/day plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg/day vs. placebo

- Outcome: ASCVD, defined as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for angina, coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, carotid artery disease, or death from cardiovascular causes

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 7.2 years for the CEE-alone trial and 5.6 years for the CEE plus MPA trial

- Among participants with moderate or severe VMS, ASCVD risk with HRT varied significantly by age.

- Age 50–59 years: HRT had a neutral effect on ASCVD risk.

- CEE alone: HR, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.53–1.35)

- CEE plus MPA: HR, 0.84 (0.44–1.57)

- Age 60–69 years: ASCVD risk was higher with CEE alone but did not reach statistical significance.

- CEE alone: HR, 1.31 (0.90–1.90)

- CEE plus MPA: HR, 0.84 (0.51–1.39)

- Age ≥ 70 years: HRT significantly increased ASCVD risk.

- CEE alone: HR, 1.95 (1.06–3.59)

- CEE plus MPA: HR, 3.22 (1.36–7.63)

- Limitations include:

- The WHI trials were not designed to study outcomes specifically in women with VMS. This secondary subgroup analysis may therefore be underpowered and prone to chance findings and confounding.

- Washout and placebo run-in requirements may have discouraged women already on HRT from enrolling, potentially lowering the observed VMS prevalence compared to the general population.

- Few women ≥ 70 years of age had moderate or severe VMS, leading to wide confidence intervals and imprecise estimates in this group.

- The study only examined one formulation and dose of oral CEE ± MPA; the findings may not apply to other formulations, doses, or routes of HRT.

- Study funding: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institutes of Health; and US Department of Health and Human Services; study medications were donated by Wyeth Ayerst.

### The fry’s the limit: potato consumption and diabetes risk

One-Minute Telegram 132-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

The association between potato consumption and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often debated. This large prospective cohort study and meta-analysis found that increased potato consumption, particularly in the form of french fries, was associated with an increased risk of T2DM; replacing potatoes with whole grains reduced T2DM risk, but replacing with white rice increased the risk. These findings emphasize that the food preparation method and type of replacement food are important determinants of health risk.

## Study breakdown

- Study population

- Cohort study: 205,107 US health professionals without diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline

- Meta-analysis: 587,081 individuals without diabetes at baseline from 13 prospective cohorts across different countries

- Study design: prospective cohort study and meta-analysis

- Prospective cohort study

- Setting: 3 US cohorts (Nurses' Health Study I, Nurses’ Health Study II, Health Professionals Follow-up Study)

- Exposure: potato consumption (assessed using questionnaires)

- Outcome: incident T2DM

- Follow-up: up to 36 years

- Meta-analysis

- Setting: 10 additional prospective cohort studies

- Exposure: potato consumption (dose-response and substitution for whole grains)

- Outcome: T2DM risk

- Follow-up: 4–27 years

- Main results

- For each incremental increase of 3 servings of potatoes/week, the risk of T2DM increased by:

- 3–5% for all potato consumption (baked, boiled, mashed, and french fries)

- 16–20% for french fry consumption

- There was no association between the intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and T2DM risk: HR for 3 servings/week, 1.01 (0.98–1.05).

- Replacing 3 servings of potatoes/week with whole grains reduced the risk of T2DM by:

- 7–8% compared to all potato consumption

- 17–19% compared to french fry consumption

- Replacing 3 servings of potatoes/week with white rice increased T2DM risk by 15–19%.

- Limitations include:

- Observational design cannot establish causality.

- Potential for recall bias and measurement error: Dietary intake was self-reported.

- Limited generalizability: The cohort study only included health professionals; 90% were White and 79% were women.

- Analyses related to substitutions were based on statistical modeling, not observed behaviors.

- Study funding: National Institutes of Health

### Peer coaching for weight loss in US veterans

One-Minute Telegram 132-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Incorporating effective weight management interventions for obesity into primary care settings is challenging. In this cluster randomized trial among US veterans, a low to moderate intensity peer coaching intervention did not lead to significantly greater weight loss at 12 months compared to enhanced usual care (EUC). However, the intervention did increase patient enrollment in more intensive weight management programs, which suggests that peer coaching can be a valuable tool for increasing patient engagement with health care.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 281 adult US veteran patients with overweight or obesity (mean age, 51 years; 79% men; 53% Black, 22% Hispanic, 17% White)

- Study design: cluster randomized clinical trial

- Setting

- Patient panels of 20 primary care providers (PCPs) at a single US Department of Veterans Affairs site in New York from 2017 to 2021

- Recruitment was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- PCP patient panels were randomized 1:1 to the peer coaching intervention (n = 120) or EUC, i.e., healthy living handouts and advice to follow up with their PCP (n = 161).

- Intervention: a tablet-based goal-setting tool with 1 in-person and up to 12 telephone coaching sessions with a trained veteran peer coach

- Primary outcome: mean change in weight at 12 months

- Follow-up: 12 months

- Main results

- There was no statistically significant difference in mean weight change at 12 months.

- Peer coaching, -2.51 kg vs. EUC, -0.79 kg

- Difference: -1.72 kg (95% CI, -3.48 to 0.04)

- At 6 months, a higher proportion of patients in the peer coaching group:

- Lost ≥ 5% of their body weight: 16.7% vs. 5.5% (difference, 11.2 percentage points; 1.0 to 21.4)

- Attended a weight management program: 28.7% vs. 13.3% (difference, 15.4 percentage points; 2.7 to 28.1)

- Limitations include:

- Reduced statistical power: unequal participant distribution between the study arms and lower enrollment than planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic

- Limited generalizability: Study participants were from a single site.

- Potential recall bias: Attendance at weight management programs was self-reported.

### Flu fighters: learn to fly past acute heart failure

One-Minute Telegram 132-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Influenza can worsen health outcomes in patients with heart failure, yet vaccination rates remain low in many parts of the world. This cluster randomized controlled trial in China found that influenza vaccination before hospital discharge in patients admitted for acute heart failure significantly reduced the combined risk of death or rehospitalization over the following year. These findings of improved survival and reduced hospitalization with influenza vaccination can be shared with patients with heart failure to help counter vaccine hesitancy in this vulnerable group.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 7771 adults hospitalized for acute moderate to severe heart failure (mean age, 72 years; 47% women; 97% Han Chinese)

- Study design: cluster randomized controlled superiority trial

- Setting: 164 county-level hospitals in China over three winter seasons (2021–2024)

- Hospitals were randomized 1:1 to intervention or usual care in the study setting (i.e., advice to obtain a self-funded influenza vaccine at a community health center).

- Intervention: free influenza vaccination administered ≤ 24 hours before hospital discharge

- Primary outcome: a composite of all-cause mortality or any hospital readmission from 31 days to 12 months after discharge (excluding summer months in northern China)

- Follow-up: 12 months

- Main results

- Compared to patients in the usual care group, patients in the vaccination group had:

- Lower all-cause mortality or hospital readmission over 12 months: odds ratio (OR), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72–0.97)

- Fewer serious adverse events: OR, 0.82 (0.70–0.96)

- Limitations include:

- Potential bias: lack of blinding at the patient and provider level

- Statistical power limitations: unequal participant distribution between the study groups

- Limited generalizability: The study population was limited to urban regions of China with a high proportion of patients with low socioeconomic status.

- COVID-19 restrictions caused fluctuations in influenza activity and mortality, potentially affecting the observed effect size.

### Edition 131 - September 13, 2025

### To transfuse or not to transfuse? A new guideline for AMI

One-Minute Telegram 131-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

The optimal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unclear. The 2025 Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies international clinical practice guidelines recommend RBC transfusion in hospitalized patients with AMI when hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is < 10 g/dL. The conditional recommendation to adopt a liberal transfusion strategy in this patient population is based on low-certainty evidence of higher mortality with more restrictive transfusion thresholds.

## Recommendations breakdown

- Applicable population: hospitalized adults with confirmed AMI

- Recommendations:

- Use a liberal RBC transfusion strategy when Hb concentration is < 10 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence).

- Incorporate the clinical context (e.g., symptoms, hemodynamic status) and patient preferences into all transfusion decisions.

- Consider strategies to mitigate adverse transfusion events.

- Rationale

- Analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) indicated a potential 1.2% reduction in 30-day mortality with a liberal compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy, surpassing the guideline panel-defined minimal important difference (MID) of 1%.

- Analysis of 2 RCTs indicated a 1.4% higher incidence of transfusion-related adverse events with a liberal compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy, which was lower than the predefined MID of 2.5%.

- The panel placed higher value on the potential benefit of a liberal transfusion strategy in reducing mortality than on the benefit of conserving RBC units and reducing the risk of adverse transfusion events with a restrictive transfusion strategy.

- Implementation

- Monitor Hb levels in patients with AMI.

- If the Hb concentration is < 10 g/dL, consider RBC transfusion.

- Implement measures to mitigate the risk of adverse transfusion events, including:

- Volume status optimization before and after transfusion

- Slow transfusion rate

- Use of diuretics

- Gradual achievement of the target Hb concentration

- Transfusions during dialysis in patients requiring renal replacement therapy

- Limitations include:

- The recommendation is based on low-certainty evidence.

- A liberal transfusion strategy had conflicting effects on mortality in the two largest trials: reduced mortality in MINT and increased mortality in REALITY.

- It is still unclear which specific subgroups of patients with AMI would benefit most from a liberal transfusion strategy.

- The guideline does not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome without AMI.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for GI bleeds: less may be more

One-Minute Telegram 131-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for 5–7 days in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) to reduce mortality. This systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found that shorter durations of antibiotics (including none) are likely noninferior to longer durations for all-cause mortality, based on evidence of low to moderate quality. These findings challenge existing guideline recommendations and emphasize the need for high-quality evidence to reassess routine antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1322 participants with cirrhosis and UGIB across 14 trials (mean age range, 41.5–62.0 years; 74% male; 91% with variceal bleeding)

- Study design: systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of RCTs

- Setting: RCTs from India, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, the UK, Spain, and France

- Intervention

- 2 RCTs: shorter duration (2–3 days) of third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prophylaxis vs. longer duration (5–7 days)

- 12 RCTs: any antibiotic prophylaxis (1–10 days) vs. no prophylaxis

- Outcomes

- Primary: all-cause mortality (with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 5%)

- Secondary: early rebleeding and bacterial infections

- Follow-up: The time point for mortality evaluation varied (4–6 weeks in most studies).

- Main results

- Compared to a longer duration of prophylaxis, a shorter duration (including no prophylaxis) had:

- 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality: risk difference (RD), 0.9% (95% credible interval, -2.6 to 4.9)

- 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding: RD, 2.9% (-4.2 to 10.0)

- A higher rate of study-defined bacterial infections: RD, 15.2% (5.0 to 25.9)

- The probability of noninferiority for mortality was highest (98.9%) in studies published after 2004, corresponding to a lower baseline risk of mortality in more recent trials.

- Limitations include:

- Included studies were of low to moderate quality, and most were unblinded, potentially introducing ascertainment bias.

- There was significant heterogeneity in infection definitions, antibiotic regimens, and patient populations.

- Funnel plot analysis suggested potential publication bias in favor of small studies that showed a benefit for longer-duration antibiotics.

- Important safety outcomes (e.g., antibiotic-related adverse events, colonization with resistant organisms) were not reported on in the original studies.

- Study funding: None reported

- Original study: Prophylactic antibiotics for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis. [23]

- Related AMBOSS articles: Esophageal varices; Cirrhosis

## Discussion points

- Study design: What are the strengths and limitations of performing a meta-analysis to answer this clinical question?

- Study methods: What is a Bayesian meta-analysis and why was it used in this study?

- Clinical application: Should these findings change the clinical practice of prescribing 5–7 days of antibiotics for patients with cirrhosis and UGIB?

### Food for thought: a recipe for a reimbursable culinary medicine clinic

One-Minute Telegram 131-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Nutrition is a cornerstone of chronic disease management, but access to practical, evidence-based nutrition counseling remains limited. In this study of a pilot culinary medicine (CM) consultation service at a US academic medical center combining physician-dietitian consultations and group visits in teaching kitchens, referral uptake was high, insurance reimbursement was near universal, and patient satisfaction was strong. This provides a feasible and financially sustainable model for integrating “food as medicine” strategies into routine clinical care for chronic diseases.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 387 total adult referrals (mean age, 54 years; 78% female; 62% Black or African American)

- Study design: descriptive analysis of a pilot program

### A CONFIDENCE boost for diabetic kidney disease

One-Minute Telegram 130-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Finerenone and SGLT-2 inhibitors are key therapies for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes, but evidence supporting their simultaneous initiation is limited. This pharmaceutical industry-sponsored randomized trial (CONFIDENCE) found that adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes experienced a greater reduction in albuminuria when treated initially with a combination of finerenone plus empagliflozin compared to either drug alone. Starting directly with combination therapy may be preferred over the traditional stepwise approach for these patients.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 800 participants (mean age 66.5 ± 10.3, 24.8% women, 46.4% Asian, 43.9% White) with type 2 diabetes, CKD with an eGFR of 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 100–5000, and already taking a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor

- Study design: double-blind, randomized, active-controlled phase 2 trial

- Setting: 143 health centers in 14 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America

- Intervention: randomized (1:1:1)

- Finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg daily plus placebo

- Empagliflozin 10 mg daily plus placebo

- A combination of finerenone and empagliflozin

- End point: relative change in mean UACR from baseline to day 180

- Follow-up: 180 days plus a further 30 days after treatment discontinuation

- Main results:

- At 180 days, the UACR reduction in the combination group was:

- 29% greater than with finerenone alone (least-squares mean ratio of the difference in the change from baseline, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.82)

- 32% greater than with empagliflozin alone (0.68; 0.59–0.79)

- A greater percentage of participants in the combination group (70%) had a reduction in UACR > 30% compared to the finerenone and empagliflozin groups (52% in both).

- Adverse events and safety:

- There were similar proportions of serious adverse events across groups (combination group, 7%; finerenone and empagliflozin groups, 6% each).

- Hyperkalemia occurred in 9% of the combination group, 11% of the finerenone group, and 4% of the empagliflozin group.

- A > 30% decrease in eGFR at day 30 was more common in the combination group (6%) than in the finerenone (4%) or empagliflozin (1%) groups. However, after the initial decrease in all groups, eGFR stabilized, the decrease was largely reversible with drug discontinuation, and acute kidney injury was rare (combination group, 2%; finerenone group, 1%; empagliflozin group, 0%).

- Limitations include:

- The trial relied on surrogate endpoints (e.g., change in UACR) instead of clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events or progression of kidney disease.

- The short follow-up period did not assess long-term efficacy or safety.

- Study funding: Bayer

- Original study: Finerenone with empagliflozin in chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. [25]

- Related AMBOSS articles: Diabetic kidney disease

## Discussion points

- Study design: Why did the investigators choose a three-arm, active-controlled design instead of a simpler placebo-controlled trial?

- Study methods: The study used the change in UACR as its primary endpoint rather than clinical outcomes such as end-stage kidney disease or cardiovascular events. What is the rationale for using this surrogate marker?

- Clinical application: Based on these findings, should clinicians favor initiating finerenone and an SGLT-2 inhibitor simultaneously over a traditional stepwise approach in eligible patients?

### A FIT-ting option for colorectal cancer screening?

One-Minute Telegram 130-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for adults at average risk starting at 45 years of age, but the best outreach method to promote screening in patients aged 45–49 years is unclear. This randomized trial with more than 20,000 participants aged 45–49 years found that mailing an unsolicited fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit to patients was more effective than three other cancer screening outreach strategies, including offering a choice of FIT or colonoscopy. These findings support mailed FIT outreach as a strategy to improve CRC screening rates in newly eligible adults aged 45 to 49 years.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 20,509 adults aged 45–49 (mean age, 47.4 years; 53.9% women; 50.8% White, 13.7% Asian, 13.4% Hispanic/Latino, 4.2% Black) at average risk for CRC

- Study design: randomized clinical trial

- Setting: a single, large, urban US academic health system

- Intervention: randomized (1:1:1:1)

- Usual care: portal message alert followed by an unsolicited FIT kit delivered by mail

- FIT-only active choice: portal message asking participants to choose between receiving a mailed FIT kit or deferring screening

- Colonoscopy-only active choice: portal message asking participants to actively choose between colonoscopy or deferring screening

- Dual-modality active choice: portal message offering a choice of FIT, colonoscopy, or deferring screening

- Primary outcome: completion of CRC screening (FIT or colonoscopy)

- Follow-up: 6 months

- Main results:

- Screening completion rates were low in all groups (overall 18.6%).

- Compared to usual care, screening completion was lower in the active choice groups:

- Usual care: 26.2%

- FIT-only active choice: 16.4%; rate difference, -9.8% (95% CI, -11.3% to -8.2%)

- Colonoscopy-only active choice: 14.5%; -11.7% (-13.2% to -10.1%)

- Dual-modality active choice: 17.4%; -8.9% (-10.5% to -7.4%)

- Participants in the dual-modality active choice group were:

- More likely to complete screening than active-choice groups offered only one modality: 17.4% vs. 15.4%; rate difference, -1.8% (-3.0% to -0.1%)

- More likely to complete screening with colonoscopy than FIT: 12.0% vs. 5.6%; -6.4% (-7.5% to -5.3%)

- Limitations include:

- The study was conducted at a single academic center, which may limit generalizability.

- The usual care arm was already a robust outreach program (mailed FIT kits), which may have made it difficult for other interventions to show a significant improvement (i.e., a ceiling effect).

- Screening completed outside the health system was not captured.

- FIT may have been easier to complete than colonoscopy in the short follow-up period (6 months).

### Stalking: dangerous now, dangerous later

One-Minute Telegram 130-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Women’s experience of intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and childhood violence is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the long-term health effects of stalking, a common form of violence against women, are unknown. This prospective cohort study of over 66,000 US female nurses found that a history of being stalked or obtaining a restraining order was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke at any given time during a 20-year follow-up. These experiences should be considered potential risk factors for CVD in women, warranting greater attention in clinical practice.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 66,270 female nurses (mean age at baseline, 46.3 years; 93.3% non-Hispanic White) in the US

- Study design: sub-study of the Nurses’ Health Study, an ongoing, prospective cohort study

- Setting: United States

- Exposure: self-reported lifetime history of being stalked or having obtained a restraining order, assessed via questionnaire in 2001

- Outcome: incident CVD, defined as self-reported, physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction or stroke, assessed via biennial questionnaire

- Main results:

- Median follow-up: 19.9 years

- Compared to women with no such history, and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic and childhood factors, and family history of CVD:

- Women with a history of being stalked (n = 7,721; 11.7%) had a 41% higher risk of developing CVD (aHR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24–1.60).

- Women with a history of obtaining a restraining order (n = 3,686; 5.6%) had a 70% higher risk of developing CVD (aHR, 1.70; 1.44–1.98).

- Women reporting both stalking and obtaining a restraining order (n = 1,895; 3%) had a 116% higher risk of developing CVD (aHR, 2.16; 1.77–2.62).

- Limitations include:

- Exposure and outcomes were self-reported, which increases the risk of recall bias.

- The study did not define the exposure in terms of length, severity, or persistence, which limits the interpretability of the estimated effect.

- History of being stalked or obtaining a restraining order was only recorded once in 2001 and was not reassessed during follow-up.

- The study sample consisted almost entirely of non-Hispanic White, educated women, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations.

- Study funding: National Institutes of Health and the Broad Trauma Initiative at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard

### A 4-day fix for burnout?

One-Minute Telegram 129-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

The workplace is an important social determinant of health. The link between long work hours and poor health outcomes has made work-time reduction a growing focus for improving well-being. In this large, nonrandomized trial, implementation of a 4-day workweek was associated with significant improvements in burnout rates, job satisfaction, and mental and physical health. A shorter workweek could be an effective organizational-level intervention to improve employee health and well-being.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 3,181 employees from 153 companies; 65% women, 76% White, 40% aged < 35 years

- Study design: nonrandomized interventional trial with a nonequivalent control group

- Setting: private-sector companies mainly in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US

- Intervention group (n = 2,896 from 141 companies): company-wide 4-day workweek (or equivalent 20% reduction in hours) with no reduction in pay

- Control group (n = 285 from 12 US-based companies): no work-hour reduction

- Participants were evaluated at baseline and after the follow-up period (participants in the control group were blinded to the study’s purpose).

- Well-being outcomes included changes in self-reported burnout, job satisfaction, mental health, and physical health.

- Follow-up: 6 months

- Main results

- Compared to baseline, employees in the trial group showed significant improvements not seen in the control group:

- Work hours: decreased by 5.20 hours; 95% CI, -5.60 to -4.80; Cohen’s effect size, -1.41

- Burnout: decreased by 0.44 points on a 1–5 scale; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.42; Cohen's d, -0.55

- Job satisfaction: increased by 0.52 points on a 0–10 scale; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.59; Cohen's d, 0.27

- Mental health: increased by 0.39 points on a 1–5 scale; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.43; Cohen's d, 0.39

- Physical health: increased by 0.28 points on a 1–5 scale; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.3; Cohen's d, 0.29

- A dose-response relationship was observed at the individual level: Greater reductions in work hours were associated with greater improvements in well-being.

- Improvements in perceived work ability, sleep problems, and fatigue were key factors that mediated the relationship between reduced work hours and improved well-being.

- Limitations include:

- The study was not a randomized trial; companies self-selected to participate, which could introduce selection bias.

- All well-being outcomes were self-reported and may be subject to reporting bias.

- The sample was disproportionately from high-income, Anglophone countries, and participating companies were often small, which may limit generalizability.

- Control companies were not representative, as they were all US-based, belonged to specific sectors (e.g., nonprofits), and were surveyed at different times than most of the trial companies.

### Ivermectin: a new bite at malaria control?

One-Minute Telegram 129-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

The spread of insecticide resistance and mosquito behavioral adaptations pose a threat to malaria control efforts, necessitating novel strategies. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that can also kill mosquitoes that feed on treated individuals. This cluster-randomized controlled trial in Kenya found that mass administration of ivermectin in a community with high bed-net use significantly reduced the incidence of malaria in children compared to albendazole. Ivermectin could be a valuable complementary tool for reducing malaria transmission.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 84 geographic clusters in a malaria-endemic area of Kenya encompassing 28,932 people, including an efficacy cohort of 2,871 children aged 5–15 years

- Study design: open-label, assessor-blinded, cluster-randomized controlled trial

- Setting: Kwale County, a coastal region of Kenya with high malaria transmission and extensive use of insecticide-treated nets

- Intervention: mass administration of either ivermectin (400 μg per kilogram of body weight) or albendazole (400 mg, as an active control) once a month for 3 consecutive months

- Primary efficacy outcome: cumulative incidence of malaria infection among children aged 5–15 years

- Primary safety outcome: overall population incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events

- Follow-up: 6 months

- Main results

- The incidence of malaria was significantly lower in the ivermectin group than in the albendazole group: 2.20 vs. 2.66 infections per child-year at risk, respectively (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.95).

- The incidence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups (IRR, 0.63; 0.21–1.91).

- A higher incidence of any adverse event was observed in the ivermectin group (IRR, 1.65; 1.17–2.34), primarily driven by systemic (mostly fatigue and fever), sensory (mostly dizziness), and neurological (mostly headaches) events.

- Limitations include:

- There were no data on the incidence of malaria in the study clusters before the intervention began.

- The provision of antimalarial treatment to all children with detected infection, including those in the control group, may have led to an underestimation of the true effect of ivermectin.

- Treatment coverage was lower in the ivermectin group, which may be related to its higher pill burden compared to the single-tablet dose of albendazole.

- The trial assessed the intervention’s effect on rates of infection among children aged 5–15 years, which is the population contributing most to malaria transmission, but did not assess the impact on malaria morbidity and mortality, which typically most severely affects children aged < 5 years and pregnant individuals.

### Carrying the weight: increased risk of mental illness in surrogate pregnancies

One-Minute Telegram 129-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Pregnancy is a period of increased psychological vulnerability, but the mental health of surrogates, important contributors to alternative family-building options, is not well understood. This large, population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, found that surrogates had a higher risk of new-onset mental illness compared with nonsurrogate pregnant individuals. These findings suggest that enhanced mental health screening, counseling, and support may be particularly important during and after a surrogate pregnancy.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 767,406 births after 20 weeks’ gestation in women aged 18–50 years (mean age, 30.5 years) who did not have a known history of mental illness before conception

- Study design: population-based, retrospective cohort study

- Setting: population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2021

- Exposure: Surrogate pregnancies (n = 758) were compared with nonsurrogate pregnancies by either unassisted conception (n = 748,732) or IVF (n = 17,916).

- Outcome: a new diagnosis of mental illness occurring between the estimated date of conception and March 31, 2024 (defined as two or more outpatient visits or at least one emergency department visit or hospital admission for a mental health illness, e.g., mood disorder, psychosis, or self-harm event)

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 4.5 years

- Incidence rates for new-onset mental illness were adjusted for age, income, parity, urban residence, obesity, smoking, and hypertension.

- The incidence rate of new-onset mental illness was highest among surrogate pregnancies at 6.9 per 100 person-years, and significantly higher when compared to the incidence rates for:

- Nonsurrogate pregnancies by unassisted conception: 5.2 per 100 person-years (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.26–1.63)

- Nonsurrogate pregnancies by IVF conception: 5.0 per 100 person-years (adjusted IRR, 1.29; 1.13–1.47)

- Limitations include:

- Reliance on administrative health data is susceptible to outcome misclassification and unaccounted confounders.

- The study used a composite primary outcome combining various mental health conditions and did not provide a stratified analysis.

- Surrogates may have received closer monitoring during and after pregnancy, increasing the likelihood of detecting mental health conditions.

### No observed link between aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and chronic childhood diseases

One-Minute Telegram 128-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Parental anxiety about the safety of childhood vaccines often focuses on animal studies that have raised theoretical concerns about the effect of aluminum-based adjuvants. This national retrospective cohort study of over 1.2 million Danish children found that cumulative vaccine-attributable aluminum exposure by 2 years of age was not associated with an increased risk of autoimmune, atopic, or neurodevelopmental disorders. This population-level evidence will hopefully reduce vaccination hesitancy and encourage increased adherence to recommended childhood immunization schedules.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1,224,176 children (48.8% female) born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 and living in Denmark at 2 years of age

- Study design: retrospective cohort study

- Setting: data from the National Health Service Register in Denmark

- Exposure: total vaccine-attributable aluminum exposure by 2 years of age

- Outcome: incident diagnosis of 50 different chronic disorders

- 36 autoimmune (e.g., Henoch-Schönlein purpura)

- 9 allergic or atopic (e.g., asthma)

- 5 neurodevelopmental (e.g., autism spectrum disorder)

- Follow-up: from 2 years of age until 5 years of age, death, or loss to follow-up

- Main results:

- Aluminum exposure from early childhood vaccinations was not associated with an increased risk for autoimmune, allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders.

- Adjusted HR per 1-mg increase in aluminum exposure for categories of disorders were:

- Any autoimmune disorder: 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94–1.02)

- Any atopic or allergic disorder: 0.99 (0.98–1.01)

- Any neurodevelopmental disorder: 0.93 (0.90–0.97)

- Adjusted HR per 1-mg increase in aluminum exposure for individual disorders could not statistically exclude increased risk for some disorders, but increased risks were unlikely to exceed 10–30%.

- Limitations include:

- Risk for residual confounding after adjustment

- Small and long-term increases in risk were not assessed because many of the diseases included were rare and others develop over extended periods.

- The results are not generalizable to settings in which vaccine formulations and/or schedules differ from those used in Denmark.

- Study funding: None

- Original study: Aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and chronic diseases in childhood: a nationwide cohort study. [32]

- Related AMBOSS articles: Vaccination; Immunization schedule

## Discussion points

Use these points to guide discussions at your journal club.

- This study was conducted in Denmark, which has more universal health care, higher childhood vaccination rates, lower levels of poverty, and a less racially and ethnically diverse population than the US. Can these findings be applied to the US patient population?

- The study followed children primarily to 5 years of age, with some extended follow-up to 8 years of age. Many autoimmune and neurodevelopmental conditions can manifest or be diagnosed later in childhood or adulthood. How should this limitation influence our interpretation of this study?

- A parent brings their 6-month-old to your clinic and expresses concern about aluminum in vaccines, citing online sources that claim it causes autism. How would you use the findings from this study to counsel the parent, and what specific aspects of the study design would you emphasize to address their concerns?

### Life expectancy after the COVID-19 pandemic: it's complicated

One-Minute Telegram 128-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Life expectancy in the US declined substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet fully recovered. In this ecological study in California, the anticipated life expectancy for children born in 2024 has risen from its nadir in 2021 but remains 0.86 years lower than the pre-pandemic level. Significant racial and ethnic disparities remain. Although COVID-19 continues to contribute to decreased life expectancy in the US, its effect has been surpassed by those of drug overdose and cardiovascular disease. Further research into social determinants of health, long-term effects of COVID-19, and emerging causes of death is necessary to understand the persistent decrease in life expectancy.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: population-level data on deaths and population counts in California

- Study design: ecological study

- Setting: vital statistics data from the California Comprehensive Death Files

- Exposures: California from 2015 to 2019 (pre-pandemic) and from 2020 to 2024

- Outcome: estimated life expectancy at birth, stratified by income quartile and race/ethnicity

- Main results:

- Life expectancy decreased between 2019 and 2021 (from 81.40 years to 78.48 years).

- Life expectancy increased after 2021 but was still 0.86 years lower in 2024 than in 2019.

- Approximately 87% of the reduced life expectancy in 2024 was attributable to causes other than COVID-19 (e.g., drug overdose, cardiovascular disease).

- The disparity in life expectancy between the highest and lowest income quartiles increased during the pandemic but returned to the 2019 baseline differences by 2024.

- Black and Hispanic populations had larger deficits in life expectancy in 2024 vs. 2019 compared to White and Asian populations.

- Black: 1.48 years

- Hispanic: 1.44 years

- Asian: 1.06 years

- White: 0.63 years

- The Black population had the lowest life expectancy among all racial and ethnic populations in both 2024 (73.42 years) and 2019 (74.90 years).

- Limitations include:

- Population estimates and death counts were preliminary.

- The contributions of long COVID were not accounted for.

- The database may have inaccurately classified the cause of death.

- Results are from one state and may not be generalizable to the entire US.

### CBD linked to liver enzyme elevations in healthy adults

One-Minute Telegram 128-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Cannabidiol (CBD) is an unregulated hemp derivative commonly used as an over-the-counter treatment for anxiety, pain, and/or insomnia, but its safety at the doses commonly consumed by adults is unclear. This randomized placebo-controlled trial found that 5.6% of healthy adults taking 5 mg/kg/day CBD for 4 weeks developed significant transaminitis, and 4.9% met the criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Long-term safety evaluations of real-world use of CBD at different dosages and durations are needed, and clinicians may want to consider cautioning and/or monitoring individuals who frequently ingest large doses of CBD.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 201 healthy adults (median age, 36 years; 44% women; 43% Black or African American, 49% White, 14% Hispanic or Latino ethnicity)

- Study design: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: clinical pharmacology unit in Wisconsin

- Intervention: Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive either an oral CBD solution 2.5 mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 28 days

- Primary outcome: percentage of participants with ALT or AST level > 3× ULN

- Secondary outcomes:

- Percentage of participants with protocol-defined criteria for withdrawal due to potential DILI

- Change from baseline in total testosterone, inhibin B, thyrotropin, total triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine levels

- Follow-up: 35 days (4-week intervention plus post-treatment visit)

- Main results:

- ALT or AST level > 3× ULN was more common in the CBD group than in the placebo group.

- CBD: 5.6% (95% CI, 1.8–9.3%)

- Placebo: 0%

- Potential DILI was more common in the CBD group than in the placebo group.

- CBD: 4.9% (1.3–8.4%)

- Placebo: 0%

- Change from baseline in testosterone, inhibin B, thyrotropin, total triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine levels was similar in the CBD and placebo groups.

- There were no serious adverse events in either group.

- Limitations include:

- The results are not generalizable to individuals with chronic health conditions and/or taking other medications.

- One-month follow-up is insufficient to assess long-term health impacts.

- Real-world applicability is uncertain: Most individuals consume CBD less frequently than in the study and often at unknown doses.

### Edition 127 - July 19, 2025

### Morphine misses the mark for breathlessness in COPD

One-Minute Telegram 127-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Low-dose morphine is often prescribed to manage chronic breathlessness in COPD, but studies on its effects during sleep are lacking. In this randomized crossover trial, morphine did not improve sleep efficiency or breathlessness, and it increased the risk of nocturnal hypoventilation and worsened overnight oxygenation. These findings challenge the assumption that low-dose morphine use in patients with COPD is harmless during sleep and emphasize that it should be used with caution.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 19 adults with COPD and chronic breathlessness despite optimal treatment (mean age, 71 years; 46% women; all community-dwelling; race/ethnicity not reported)

- Study design: randomized, double-anonymized, placebo-controlled crossover trial

- Setting: Australian sleep research center

- Intervention: sustained-release morphine 20 mg/evening for 3 days vs. placebo, followed by a ≥ 4-day washout period, then crossover

- Outcomes

- Primary: sleep efficiency (total sleep time percentage, measured with polysomnography)

- Secondary: nocturnal oxygenation, sleep-disordered breathing events (apnea-hypopnea index), transcutaneous CO2 tension, sleep architecture changes, subjective breathlessness, performance on a driving simulator on day 4

- Follow-up: at the end of each 3-day treatment course

- Main results

- No difference in sleep efficiency

- Morphine 67±4% vs. placebo 66±4%

- Mean difference: 0.6% (95% CI, -6.5% to 7.7%)

- No difference in sleep-disordered breathing events

- Morphine 28±7 events/hour vs. placebo 28±7 events/hour

- Mean difference: 2 events/hour (95% CI, -4 to 9 events/hour)

- The morphine group had:

- Lower mean and nadir overnight oxygen saturation and REM sleep than the placebo group

- Higher levels of nocturnal hypoventilation, spontaneous arousals, adverse events (mostly nausea), and mean transcutaneous CO2 than the placebo group

- No improvement in subjective breathlessness

- No difference in day 4 driving simulator performance

- Limitations include:

- Small sample size (n = 19) and short treatment duration

- Laboratory-based sleep studies may not reflect real-world sleep patterns.

- Participants may have had milder breathlessness than typical candidates for morphine.

- Possible unblinding due to morphine adverse effects (e.g., nausea)

- Lack of stratified sampling (e.g., race/ethnicity)

### A new oral option for UTIs?

One-Minute Telegram 127-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, but increasing antibiotic resistance limits treatment options. In this pharmaceutical industry-sponsored trial, a 5-day course of oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid was noninferior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for treating uncomplicated UTIs in women, but it caused more frequent treatment-emergent adverse events; there was a high level of treatment failure in both groups. The availability of an oral agent active against multidrug-resistant uropathogens could help the outpatient management of UTIs.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 990 women (median age, 51 years; 64% Hispanic or Latina; 80% White) with a symptomatic uncomplicated UTI and a urine culture positive for ≥ 1 Enterobacterales uropathogen (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella species)

- Study design: phase 3, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial

- Setting: 139 outpatient centers in the US

- Intervention: sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (sulopenem) 500 mg/500 mg PO twice daily vs. amoxicillin/clavulanate (amox/clav) 875 mg/125 mg PO twice daily, each for 5 days

- End points

- Primary: composite of clinical cure and microbiological eradication at day 12

- Secondary: individual components of the primary end point at various time points, adverse events

- Additional assessments: antimicrobial susceptibility at baseline and days 5, 12, and 28

- Follow-up: symptom assessment and urine culture on days 5, 12, and 28

- Main results

- Noninferiority criteria were met for the primary end point at day 12.

- Sulopenem 60.9% vs. amox/clav 55.6%

- Difference: 5.4% (95% CI, -0.8 to 11.5)

- Treatment-emergent adverse events: sulopenem 18.9% vs. amox/clav 12.3%

- Diarrhea: sulopenem 8.1% vs. amox/clav 4.1%

- Nausea: 4.3% vs. 2.9%

- Headache: 2.2% vs. 1.5%

- Antimicrobial resistance increased in the amox/clav group (1.8% at baseline compared to 10.5% after treatment); no change was observed in the sulopenem group.

- Limitations include:

- The comparison group did not receive a currently recommended first-line antibiotic regimen for UTIs.

- The calculated sample size was not met for the primary outcome.

- The results cannot be generalized to women with complicated UTIs, men with UTIs, or female adolescents.

- The short follow-up time (28 days total) does not allow for assessment of long-term resistance.

### Pressure drop: a win for lorundrostat

One-Minute Telegram 127-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Increased aldosterone production is an important underlying mechanism of uncontrolled hypertension, including treatment-resistant hypertension. In this international, pharmaceutical industry-sponsored trial, a 6-week course of lorundrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients already taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications, compared to placebo. Lorundrostat was well-tolerated and represents a promising treatment option, especially for individuals with uncontrolled hypertension.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1083 adults with uncontrolled hypertension despite taking 2–5 antihypertensive medications (mean age, 61.6 years; 47% female; 29% Black; 68% White; 63% BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2; 40% taking 2 medications; 60% taking ≥ 3)

- Study design: phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: 159 clinics in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the US

- Intervention: Participants were randomized 1:2:1 to lorundrostat 50 mg/day for 6 weeks followed by 100 mg/day (if tolerated) for 6 weeks; lorundrostat 50 mg/day for 12 weeks; or placebo for 12 weeks.

- Outcomes

- Primary: change in automated office SBP at 6 weeks

- Secondary outcomes included office SBP < 130 mm Hg at 6 weeks, change in SBP stratified by number of antihypertensives and by BMI, and change in SBP at 12 weeks.

- Follow-up: 12 weeks

- Main results

- SBP reduction at 6 weeks

- Lorundrostat 50 mg/day: -16.9 mm Hg (95% CI, -19.0 to -14.9 mm Hg)

- Placebo: -7.9 mm Hg (-11.5 to -4.2 mm Hg)

- Difference: -9.1 mm Hg (-13.3 to -4.9 mm Hg)

- Efficacy was similar across groups irrespective of BMI, number of prescribed antihypertensives, age, gender, and race.

- Percentage of participants with SBP < 130 mm Hg at 6 weeks: lorundrostat 44% vs. placebo 24% (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5 to 7.8)

- No increased benefit in the group with dose escalation to lorundrostat 100 mg/day

- Adverse events

- Treatment-emergent adverse events: lorundrostat 54% vs. placebo 36%

- Severe events: lorundrostat 2% vs. placebo 3%

- There were more cases of electrolyte abnormalities and kidney function decline in the lorundrostat group than in the placebo group.

- The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was very low (< 1%) in all groups.

- Limitations include:

- Short follow-up period

- Results cannot be generalized to patients with baseline electrolyte abnormalities and/or decreased kidney function.

- It is not possible to extrapolate long-term cardiovascular end points based on short-term BP reduction.

### A second set of AI-s for prostate MRI

One-Minute Telegram 126-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Reading prostate MRIs to assess for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is challenging and subject to variability between radiologists. This international study found that providing radiologists with AI assistance significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for csPCa compared with unassisted readings. These findings suggest that integrating AI tools into radiology workflows could enhance the detection of csPCa.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: biparametric MRI examinations from 360 male patients (median age, 65 years; median PSA level, 7.0 ng/mL) with suspected prostate cancer based on PSA levels ≥ 3 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE findings

- Study design: international, retrospective, diagnostic accuracy, multireader, multicase study

- Setting: four European medical centers (3 in the Netherlands and 1 in Norway)

- Exposure: presence or absence of AI assistance for evaluation of prostate MRI examinations by 61 readers (34 experts, 27 nonexperts) using a crossover design (each reader assessed all cases with and without AI, separated by a washout period)

- AI assistance provided a lesion-detection map and a patient-level suspicion score from 1 to 10, with 10 representing the highest likelihood of csPCa.

- Readers scored prostate lesions using the 5-point Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS); a higher score indicates a higher risk of csPCa.

- The presence of csPCa was based on histopathology from prostate biopsy samples; absence was defined as no csPCa during 3 years of follow-up.

- The primary outcome was the evaluation of AI-assisted vs. unassisted diagnosis of csPCa using:

- Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores, which were based on patient-level suspicion scores during assessment

- Sensitivity and specificity for csPCa at a PI-RADS threshold of 3 or more

- Secondary outcomes included a comparison of improvement in nonexpert readers and expert readers utilizing AI assistance.

- Main results

- AI assistance significantly improved the mean reader AUROC by 3.3% (1.8%–4.9%).

- Unassisted AUROC: 0.882 (95% CI, 0.854–0.910)

- AI-assisted AUROC: 0.916 (95% CI, 0.893–0.938)

- A standalone AI system outperformed both unassisted and AI-assisted readers, with an AUROC score of 0.947 (95% CI, 0.927–0.968).

- At a PI-RADS threshold of ≥ 3:

- Sensitivity significantly increased from 94.3% to 96.8% with AI assistance (difference, 2.5%; 1.1%–3.9%).

- Specificity significantly increased from 46.7% to 50.1% with AI assistance (difference, 3.4%; 0.8%–6.0%).

- Nonexpert readers derived greater benefit from AI assistance than experts.

- Limitations include:

- The study was retrospective, with data derived mostly from a single MRI manufacturer.

- The assessments do not reflect real-world clinical workflows or efficiency, as they were carried out in a controlled, simulated reading environment in which every assessment was performed twice, before and after a 4-week washout period.

- For patients with a negative MRI, the absence of cancer was confirmed by follow-up rather than histopathology.

- Study funding: Health-Holland and the European Union's Horizon 2020

- Original study: AI-assisted vs unassisted identification of prostate cancer in magnetic resonance images [38]

## Discussion points

Use these points to guide discussions at your journal club.

- Study design: How might the results differ in a real-world clinical setting with factors like time pressure and interruptions?  [39][40]

- Clinical application: Is the improvement in diagnostic accuracy enough to justify the cost of implementing this AI system?

### Navigating the path to cancer screening

One-Minute Telegram 126-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Patient navigation programs aim to help patients overcome barriers to cancer screening and follow-up care. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized clinical trials found that compared to usual care, patient navigation programs significantly increased screening rates for breast cancer and cervical cancer as well as follow-up rates after abnormal breast cancer findings. Implementing patient navigation programs, especially for underserved populations, is an evidence-based strategy to improve cancer screening uptake and reduce care disparities.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 39,111 women eligible for breast or cervical cancer screening from 42 randomized clinical trials (population characteristics varied by trial; many trials focused on underserved racial, ethnic, or low-income groups)

- Study design: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials

- Setting: health systems and clinical practice settings in 19 US states and in British Columbia, Canada

- Intervention: patient navigation (e.g., individualized education, scheduling assistance, reminders, and/or addressing barriers such as transportation and language) vs. usual care

- Outcomes

- Screening rates for breast cancer and cervical cancer within 1 year of intervention

- Follow-up rates within 2 years of abnormal results

- Harms related to navigation services

- Follow-up: up to 2 years for the screening outcomes

- Main results

- Compared to usual care, patient navigation significantly increased:

- Breast cancer screening rates: RR, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.30–1.75)

- Cervical cancer screening rates: RR, 1.62 (1.28–2.09)

- Follow-up rates after abnormal breast cancer results: RR, 1.23 (1.15–1.41)

- The increase in follow-up rates after abnormal cervical cancer results (based on 2 RCTs) was not statistically significant: RR, 1.63 (0.86–2.65).

- No harms associated with patient navigation were reported.

- Limitations include:

- High statistical heterogeneity among the trials due to variations in patient populations, navigation interventions, and settings

- Potential for publication bias, as suggested by funnel plot asymmetry, which could inflate the estimated effects

- Only English-language studies were included, and most studies took place in the US health care system, limiting generalizability to other populations.

- The analysis for follow-up after abnormal cervical cancer results was based on only 2 trials and may have been underpowered.

### A DAPA-tive response to MASH?

One-Minute Telegram 126-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is a progressive liver disease with limited treatment options. In this randomized clinical trial, 48 weeks of treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvements in MASH, liver fibrosis, and MASH resolution among adults with biopsy-confirmed disease. Dapagliflozin is already used for common MASH comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and heart failure and may provide a dual therapeutic benefit for patients with MASH.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 154 adults with biopsy-diagnosed MASH (mean age, 35 years)

- Study design: multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: six tertiary hospitals in China between November 2018 and March 2023

- Intervention: 48 weeks of once daily treatment with either dapagliflozin 10 mg orally or a matching placebo

- Primary endpoint: MASH improvement, defined as a decrease of ≥ 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) or an NAS of ≤ 3 points, without worsening of fibrosis (based on fibrosis stage)

- Secondary endpoints included: MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH

- Follow-up: 48 weeks

- Main results

- Primary endpoint: MASH improvement without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 53% of patients taking dapagliflozin vs. 30% taking a placebo (RR: 1.73; 95% CI, 1.16–2.58).

- Secondary endpoints: Dapagliflozin led to higher rates of MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement compared to placebo.

- MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis: 23% vs. 8% (RR, 2.91; 1.22–6.97)

- Fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH: 45% vs. 20% (RR, 2.25; 1.35–3.75)

- Rates of adverse events were similar between the groups, and discontinuation due to adverse events was low (1% in the dapagliflozin group vs. 3% in the placebo group).

- Limitations include:

- The primary endpoint was an improvement in MASH, not the resolution of MASH or fibrosis improvement endpoints now preferred by the FDA for MASH trials.

- The trial was conducted exclusively in a Chinese population, which may limit generalizability.

- As the study population was predominantly young and male, the results may not be applicable to older or female patients with MASH.

- The study was not large enough or long enough to assess for complications of MASH such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

- Study funding: Several Chinese national science and research grants, including grants from the Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases-National Science and Technology Major Project, National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, and Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China

### Exercise your right to better colon cancer outcomes

One-Minute Telegram 125-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, and interventions to improve outcomes after treatment are needed. This phase 3 trial found that, following adjuvant chemotherapy for resected colon cancer, a 3-year structured exercise program significantly improved survival compared to health education alone. These findings support the incorporation of structured exercise into standard care after treatment for colon cancer.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 889 patients with resected stage III or high-risk stage II colorectal adenocarcinoma who recently completed adjuvant chemotherapy (median age, 61 years; 51% women; 90% with stage III disease; 94% Australian or Canadian)

- Methods: phase 3, randomized trial

- Setting: 55 clinical sites in 6 countries

- Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either:

- Health education materials promoting exercise and healthy nutrition (health education group)

- Health education materials and a 3-year structured aerobic exercise program comprising an exercise guidebook, behavioral support, and supervised exercise sessions (exercise group)

- Primary outcome: disease-free survival (time to recurrence, new primary disease, or death)

- Key secondary outcomes: overall survival, objective fitness measures (e.g., 6-minute walk distance), self-reported physical functioning

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 7.9 years

- Compared to patients in the health education group, patients in the exercise group had:

- Longer disease-free survival: HR for disease recurrence, new primary disease, or death, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55–0.94)

- Higher 8-year overall survival: 90.3% vs. 83.2%; difference, 7.1% (1.8–12.3%)

- Greater improvement from baseline in self-reported functioning and objective fitness measures

- Musculoskeletal adverse events were more common in the exercise group than in the health education group (18.5% vs. 11.5%).

- Limitations include:

- The study was limited to individuals with high baseline functional status (ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1).

- The timing of intervention (within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy completion) excluded patients with poor recovery or early recurrence.

- Increased social contact with physical activity consultants may have confounded the positive results observed in the exercise group.

- A lower-than-expected event rate may have underpowered the study, reducing the precision and reliability of outcomes analysis.

- The resource-intensive intervention, involving up to 6 behavioral support and supervised exercise sessions per month, may be challenging to implement in real-world settings.

### We’re clot kidding! New AABB/ICTMG guidelines favor restricting platelet transfusions

One-Minute Telegram 125-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Platelet transfusion is an important therapeutic strategy for patients with platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia; however, it is not without risk. The 2025 AABB and ICTMG international guidelines for platelet transfusion recommend restrictive transfusion parameters (e.g., lower platelet count threshold for transfusion) for certain conditions in both adults and children. Adoption of restrictive platelet transfusion strategies appears safe and may help optimize clinical outcomes and reduce system burdens.

## Recommendations breakdown

- Recommendations

- Recommended platelet transfusion threshold by indication

- Lumbar puncture: platelets < 20×103/mcL (strong recommendation)

- Central venous catheter placement at compressible sites in adults: platelets < 10×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- Low-risk interventional radiology procedures in adults: platelets < 20×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- High-risk interventional radiology procedures in adults: platelets < 50×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- Major nonneuraxial surgery: platelets < 50×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- Hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant: platelets < 10×103/mcL (strong recommendation)

- Consumptive thrombocytopenia due to critical illness (non-dengue) in adults without major bleeding: platelets < 10×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- Thrombocytopenia in preterm neonates without major bleeding: platelets < 25×103/mcL (strong recommendation)

- Platelet transfusion should NOT be performed for the following:

- Dengue-related consumptive thrombocytopenia with no major bleeding (strong recommendation)

- Cardiovascular surgery with a normal platelet count and no major bleeding (conditional recommendation)

- Nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelets > 100×103/mcL (conditional recommendation)

- Prophylactic platelet transfusion should NOT be performed for hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding adults undergoing autologous stem cell transplant or with aplastic anemia (conditional recommendation).

- Rationale

- Evidence suggests that restrictive transfusion does not increase mortality or major bleeding compared to liberal transfusion in defined clinical populations.

- Restrictive approaches aim to reduce transfusion-related adverse reactions, mitigate platelet shortages, and lower health care costs.

- Implementation: In addition to these recommendations, clinical context (symptoms, signs, other laboratory parameters, bleeding history, medications), patient values and preferences, and alternative therapies must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

- Additional information

- Evidence base: This guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to findings from 21 randomized clinical trials and 13 observational studies.

- Risks of platelet transfusion include allergic reactions, febrile nonhemolytic reactions, sepsis, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).

- It is difficult to maintain a consistent platelet supply, partly due to their short shelf life (5–7 days).

- Limitations include:

- Evidence certainty was low or very low for some recommendations.

- Studies included in this guideline may not have fully captured individual bleeding risk given the heterogeneous patient population and likely variable baseline bleeding risk across studies.

- Some considerations informing the guideline recommendations (e.g., determination of minimal important differences) were influenced by panel members' values and preferences, which may not represent those of individual patients.

- Some conditions and clinical scenarios were not addressed by this guideline (e.g., severe consumptive thrombocytopenia not associated with critical illness).

### Can digital reminders close preventative care gaps?

One-Minute Telegram 125-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Digital nudges (text messages sent directly to patients before primary care visits) have been shown to increase uptake of influenza vaccination in one study. In this cluster randomized trial, digital nudges informing patients of multiple adult health maintenance gaps (e.g., vaccination, cancer screening) did not significantly increase the number of preventive health care gaps addressed on the day or closed within 90 days of a primary care visit compared to usual care. Other barriers to addressing preventive care gaps may need to be tackled for digital nudges to be effective.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 76 primary care practices, comprising 204 clinicians (54% female, 66% physicians, 81% family medicine trained) and 29,334 adult patient encounters (mean age, 57 years; 61% female; 67% White)

- Study design: cluster randomized controlled trial

- Setting: primary care practices in a single Catholic health care system in 4 US states (Alabama, Kansas, Tennessee, and Texas)

- Intervention: practices were randomized to either

- Digital care plan nudge (text message sent to patients 3 days and 1 day before a return primary care visit informing them of ≤ 3 open care gaps)

- Usual care

- Primary outcome: open care gaps addressed on the day of the visit

- Secondary outcomes

- Care gaps closed within 90 days of the visit

- Appointment attendance (post hoc)

- Main results

- Care gaps addressed on the day of the visit were similar in the digital nudge and usual care groups.

- Digital nudge: 23.5%

- Usual care: 20.3%

- Adjusted difference: 3.8% (95% CI, -0.4 to 8.1%)

- Care gaps closed within 90 days were slightly higher in the digital nudge group than the usual care group.

- Digital nudge: 31.5%

- Usual care: 27.6%

- Adjusted difference: 5.4% (0.7 to 10.1%)

- Appointment attendance was also slightly higher in the digital nudge group than the usual care group.

- Digital nudge: 74.9%

- Usual care: 72.1%

- Unadjusted difference: 2.8% (1.8 to 3.8%)

- Limitations include:

- Limited generalizability given the study’s focus on a single health care system in 4 US states

- The study may have been underpowered: The rate of care gap closure was lower than expected in the usual care group, and intracluster correlation (the tendency of study participants from the same randomized primary care practice to be similar) was not accounted for in sample size calculations.

- Interventions directed only at patients may have limited effectiveness in overcoming systemic barriers to closing preventive health care gaps.

### Edition 124 - June 7, 2025

### Man vs. machine (learning): similar quality, but machines make more mistakes?

One-Minute Telegram 124-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Discharge summaries are an important tool for ensuring patient safety during transitions of care, but creating high-quality documentation is time-consuming for physicians. In this cross-sectional study, discharge summaries generated by large language models (LLMs) had comparable overall narrative quality to those written by physicians. The number of individual errors was higher with LLMs; the potential for harm from individual errors was similar in LLM and physician narratives. LLMs may support physicians in crafting initial drafts of discharge summaries, but human review is still required.

## Study breakdown

- Study sample: 100 inpatient hospital medicine encounters between 2019 and 2022, lasting 3–6 days

- Study design: cross-sectional study

- Setting: University of California, San Francisco electronic data repository

- Exposure: blinded evaluation of physician- vs. LLM-generated discharge summary narratives by 22 attending physicians

- Outcomes

- Errors: inaccuracies, omissions, and hallucinations

- Narrative quality (measured on a 1–5 Likert scale): comprehensiveness, concision, coherence, and overall quality

- Potential for harm, based on an adaptation of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Common Format Harm Scale (measured on a scale from 0 to 7)

- Reviewer preference

- Main results

- Overall quality and reviewer preference were similar for LLM- and physician-generated narratives.

- Mean overall quality: 3.67 (±0.49) for LLM vs. 3.77 (±0.57) for physician, P = 0.21

- No statistically significant difference in the distribution of discharge summary preference (i.e., physician vs. LLM vs. equal preference) across physician groups (hospitalists, primary care physicians, and skilled nursing facility physicians), P = 0.27

- LLM narratives contained more individual errors than physician narratives.

- Mean errors per narrative: LLM 2.91 (±2.54) vs. physician 1.82 (±1.94), P < 0.001

- Inaccuracies: LLM 0.93 (±0.99) vs. physician 0.65 (±1.01), P < 0.01

- Omissions: LLM 1.75 (±2.09) vs. physician 0.86 (±1.43), P < 0.001

- Hallucinations were similar in both groups: LLM 0.23 (±0.51) vs. physician 0.31 (±0.53), P = 0.23.

- Mean harmfulness score for individual errors: 1.35 (±1.07) for LLM vs. 1.34 (±1.05) for physician, P = 0.99

- LLM narratives were significantly more concise and coherent but were less comprehensive than physician narratives.

- Limitations include:

- Blinding was potentially compromised due to stylistic differences in the narratives (e.g., use of abbreviations, redacted patient information).

- Limited generalizability due to:

- Low sample size

- Exclusion of hospital stays > 6 days

### Initial therapy with methotrexate noninferior to prednisone in pulmonary sarcoidosis

One-Minute Telegram 124-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Pulmonary involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis, but first-line treatment with prednisone is associated with many adverse effects. In this open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial, initial treatment with methotrexate was noninferior to treatment with prednisone in mean change in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) over 24 weeks. Methotrexate may be considered as an initial treatment option for pulmonary sarcoidosis, with decisions guided by patient-specific factors and tolerance for potential adverse effects.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 138 adults (mean age, 47 years, 74% male, 85% White) with pulmonary sarcoidosis (mean percentage of predicted FVC, 77.3) who had not previously received treatment

- Study design: open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial

- Setting: 17 hospitals in the Netherlands

- Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive treatment for 24 weeks with either:

- Prednisone: 40 mg/day, tapered to 10 mg over 16 weeks

- Methotrexate: 15 mg/week, up to a max. dose of 25 mg/week

- Primary endpoint: mean change in percentage of predicted FVC from baseline to 24 weeks

- Conducted using a modified intention-to-treat analysis

- Noninferiority margin: 5 percentage points

- Secondary endpoints included adverse events and patient-reported outcomes such as changes in health status, fatigue, and quality of life.

- Main results

- Methotrexate was noninferior to prednisone in mean change in percentage of predicted FVC.

- Unadjusted mean change

- Prednisone: 6.75 percentage points (95% CI, 4.50 to 8.99)

- Methotrexate: 6.11 percentage points (3.72 to 8.50)

- Adjusted between-group difference confirmed noninferiority: -1.17 percentage points (-4.27 to 1.93)

- There were no significant differences in changes in patient-reported outcomes between the methotrexate and prednisone groups.

- Most patients in both groups experienced adverse events (96% with prednisone, 94% with methotrexate), most commonly:

- Prednisone: weight gain, insomnia, and increased appetite

- Methotrexate: nausea, fatigue, and abnormal LFTs

- Limitations include:

- All participants were from a single country and 85% White, limiting generalizability.

- Lack of blinding from the open-label design increases the risk of bias (e.g., information bias).

- Drug dosages differ from current guidelines and may not reflect current practice.

### Resistant BP? Don’t let it ride, consider amiloride!

One-Minute Telegram 124-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Patients with hypertension resistant to 3 classes of antihypertensives are often treated with spironolactone, which may cause hyperkalemia and antiandrogenic effects. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic with lower rates of hyperkalemia than spironolactone, and it is not associated with antiandrogenic effects. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial in patients with resistant hypertension, the addition of amiloride to a 3-drug regimen (comprising an angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and thiazide diuretic) was noninferior to the addition of spironolactone regarding change in mean ambulatory SBP after 12 weeks. Amiloride may be an alternative fourth antihypertensive in patients with resistant hypertension.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 118 adults aged 19–75 years (median age, 55 years, 70% male) with resistant hypertension (i.e., SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg while taking 3 antihypertensives)

- Study design: open-label, blinded endpoint, randomized clinical trial

- Setting: 14 sites in South Korea

- Run-in period: Individuals with SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg after 4 weeks of treatment with fixed dosages of an angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and thiazide diuretic were eligible for randomization 1:1 to the addition of spironolactone or amiloride.

- Intervention

- Spironolactone 12.5 mg/day (could be increased to 25 mg/day)

- Amiloride 5 mg/day (could be increased to 10 mg/day)

- Primary endpoint: change in ambulatory SBP from baseline to week 12 (noninferiority margin, -4.4 mm Hg)

- Secondary endpoints included rates of ambulatory and office-measured SBP < 130 mm Hg.

- Main results

- Amiloride was noninferior to spironolactone regarding change in mean ambulatory SBP.

- Amiloride: -13.6 (±8.6) mm Hg

- Spironolactone: -14.7 (±11) mm Hg

- Adjusted between-group difference in change confirmed noninferiority: -0.68 mm Hg (90% CI, -3.50 to 2.14 mm Hg).

- The percentage of participants achieving SBP < 130 mm Hg was similar in both groups.

- Ambulatory SBP: 66.1% with amiloride vs. 55.2% with spironolactone (P = 0.23)

- Office SBP: 57.1% with amiloride vs. 60.3% with spironolactone (P = 0.73)

- Drug-related adverse events were rare in both groups.

- Limitations include:

- The dosage of spironolactone was lower than the 2017 AHA guideline recommended dosage of 25–100 mg/day.

- Individuals with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded, limiting generalizability to patients with chronic kidney disease.

- The study was conducted in a single country, which limits generalizability.

### Cancer risk from CT: imaging’s hidden negatives

One-Minute Telegram 123-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Computed tomography (CT) is an essential part of today’s medical practice, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient outcomes. But the inconvenient truth is that ionizing radiation from CT scans also substantially increases cancer risks. In this study, established radiation risk modelling projected that the 93 million CT scans performed in 2023 in the US may result in 102,700 future cancers. These sobering numbers emphasize the need for clinicians to carefully consider the use of CT scans and for radiologists to minimize the radiation from each scan.

## Study breakdown

- Study design: risk model

- A model of radiation exposure was constructed from data in the UCSF CT dose registry, containing information from 143 US hospitals and outpatient facilities.

- Distribution of CT scans by age, sex, body region, and indication was calculated from historical data (2018–2020).

- Scans were assigned to 1 of 26 categories based on body region and clinical indication.

- Radiation absorption was estimated based on the assigned CT category.

- The number of CT examinations performed in 2023 was estimated based on survey results from 235 hospitals and 78 imaging centers; scans in the last 2 years of life were excluded.

- Future lifetime radiation-induced cancer risk was projected using the National Cancer Institute’s Radiation Risk Assessment Tool.

- Outcome: projected incidence of lifetime radiation-induced cancer

- Main results

- 102,700 (90% uncertainty limits, 96,400–109,500) radiation-induced cancers were projected to result from the 93 million CT scans performed on 62 million individuals in 2023.

- Radiation-induced cancer risk was higher in children and adolescents than in adults, but most cancers occurred in adults because of higher CT utilization.

- The most common radiation-induced cancers were lung cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, stomach cancer, and bladder cancer.

- Most cancers were projected to be caused by abdominal and pelvic CT scans, which have the highest radiation dose.

- Limitations include:

- Radiation risk estimate models are based on data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and may not be generalizable to the current US population.

- Risk calculations did not consider the possible shortened life expectancy in individuals who require a CT scan, which may have increased the estimated risk of lifetime radiation-induced cancer.

- CT scans were categorized based on historical data, increasing the risk of miscategorization.

### A single injection of lepodisiran provides long-term lipoprotein(a) reduction

One-Minute Telegram 123-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Elevated serum lipoprotein(a) concentration is strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but traditional interventions for ASCVD (e.g., lifestyle modification, statin therapy) have minimal effect on lipoprotein(a) levels. In this industry-sponsored phase 2 RCT, lipoprotein(a) concentration was significantly lower at day 180 after a single injection of lepodisiran compared to placebo. Inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of lipoprotein(a) with extended-duration small interfering RNAs such as lepodisiran may revolutionize the management of ASCVD.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 320 adults ≥ 40 years of age (mean age, 62.7 years, 43% women, 81.3% White) with serum lipoprotein(a) concentration ≥ 175 nmol/L (median, 253.9 nmol/L)

- Study design: randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial

- Setting: 66 international centers in China, Japan, Europe, and North and South America

- Intervention: randomized 1:2:2:2:2 to receive

- Lepodisiran 16 mg SQ on day 0 and day 180

- Lepodisiran 96 mg SQ on day 0 and day 180

- Lepodisiran 400 mg SQ on day 0 and day 180

- Lepodisiran 400 mg SQ on day 0 and placebo on day 180

- Placebo on day 0 and day 180

- Primary endpoint: time-averaged percent change in placebo-adjusted lipoprotein(a) concentration during day 60–180 compared to baseline

- Secondary endpoints included time-averaged percent change in placebo-adjusted lipoprotein(a) concentration during day 30–360 compared to baseline.

- Main results

- Serum lipoprotein(a) concentration decreased in all lepodisiran groups during day 60–180 compared to baseline.

- Lepodisiran 16 mg: -40.8 percentage points (95% CI, -55.8 to -20.6)

- Lepodisiran 96 mg: -75.2 percentage points (-80.4 to -68.5)

- Lepodisiran 400 mg (pooled data): -93.9 percentage points (-95.1 to -92.5)

- Serum lipoprotein(a) concentration decreased during day 30–360 compared to baseline in all lepodisiran groups, with the highest doses showing the greatest efficacy.

- Lepodisiran 16 mg: -41.2 percentage points (-55.4 to -22.4)

- Lepodisiran 96 mg: -77.2 percentage points (-81.8 to -71.5)

- Lepodisiran 400 mg day 0 and placebo day 180: -88.5 percentage points (-90.8 to -85.6)

- Lepodisiran 400 mg day 0 and day 180: -94.8 percentage points (-95.9 to -93.4)

- No serious adverse effects were attributed to lepodisiran.

- Limitations include:

- The correlation between reduction in lipoprotein(a) concentration and the incidence of major cardiovascular events has not been studied, limiting clinical application; this will be studied in a follow-up trial.

- The study population was approximately 80% White, limiting generalizability.

- The effect of additional doses of lepodisiran was not studied and may affect clinical outcomes.

### Cytisinicline for smoking cessation: the competition just went up in smoke

One-Minute Telegram 123-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Cigarette smoking continues to be a major contributor to premature death, but currently approved smoking cessation medications have low efficacy and/or significant adverse effects. In this placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, cytisinicline, which has recently been granted breakthrough therapy designation for the management of vaping dependence, was well-tolerated and associated with sixfold higher odds of smoking cessation than placebo through 24 weeks. Cytisinicline’s ability to reduce nicotine craving makes it an attractive option for smoking cessation.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 792 individuals ≥ 18 years of age (mean age, 52 years, 55.4% female) who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes per day (mean, 20.4 cigarettes per day) with ≥ 10 ppm expired CO

- Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial

- Setting: 20 clinical trial sites in the US

- Intervention: randomized 1:1:1

- Cytisinicline 3 mg PO three times a day for 12 weeks

- Cytisinicline 3 mg PO three times a day for 6 weeks, followed by placebo three times a day for 6 weeks

- Placebo three times a day for 12 weeks

- All participants received continuous behavioral support.

- Assessment: Breath CO levels were measured weekly on weeks 2–12 and weeks 16, 20, and 24.

- Primary outcome: biochemically verified smoking abstinence (breath CO level < 10 ppm) during the last 4 weeks of treatment

- Secondary outcome: biochemically verified smoking abstinence from the end of treatment through 24 weeks

- Follow-up: through week 24

- Main results

- Smoking abstinence during treatment was higher in both cytisinicline groups than in the placebo group.

- 6-week treatment: 14.8% abstinence with cytisinicline vs. 6.0% with placebo in weeks 3–6 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5–5.6)

- 12-week treatment: 30.3% abstinence with cytisinicline vs. 9.4% with placebo in weeks 9–12 (4.4; 2.6–7.3)

- Continuous abstinence following treatment was higher in both cytisinicline groups than in the placebo group.

- 6-week treatment: 6.8% with cytisinicline vs. 1.1% with placebo (6.3; 1.8–34.6)

- 12-week treatment: 20.5% with cytisinicline vs. 4.2% with placebo (5.8; 2.9–12.4)

- Adherence in the cytisinicline groups was high (76% in the 6-week group, 78% in the 12-week group) and comparable to the placebo group (77%).

- There were no treatment-related serious adverse effects.

- Limitations include:

- Behavioral support for all participants was high, which may have influenced the results.

- Approximately 80% of participants were White, limiting generalizability to other racial and ethnic groups.

- All participants smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes per day before the trial; results cannot be generalized to individuals who smoke fewer cigarettes per day.

### In a pill or a shot, naltrexone takes the edge off when reducing alcohol consumption

One-Minute Telegram 122-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Despite the availability of safe and effective pharmacotherapies such as naltrexone to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD), most individuals with AUD do not receive treatment. In this randomized clinical trial of oral vs. injectable naltrexone initiated at hospital discharge in adults with AUD, both formulations reduced heavy drinking days and utilization of acute health care services at 3 months compared to baseline. Increased motivation to decrease alcohol use after hospitalization along with the ability to initiate either formulation of naltrexone in the hospital is a promising combination for the treatment of AUD.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 248 hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years (80% male; mean age, 49 years) with AUD and ≥ 1 heavy drinking days (≥ 5 drinks for men, ≥ 4 drinks for women) within the 30 days before hospitalization

- Study design: randomized comparative clinical trial

- Setting: single urban academic hospital in the US

- Intervention: randomized 1:1 to daily oral or monthly extended-release injectable naltrexone

- Primary outcome: percent change in heavy drinking days from the 30 days before enrollment to the 30 days before the 3-month follow-up

- Secondary outcome: self-reported acute health care utilization (ED or hospitalization) during the 3-month study period

- Other self-reported outcomes included health care costs (e.g., cost of study drugs, necessary medical management of study drug use, acute health care utilization costs) and medication adherence.

- Main results

- Decrease in heavy drinking days in the past 30 days

- Oral: -38% (95% CI, -125% to 48%)

- Injectable: -46% (-123% to 31%)

- Difference: -8% (-19% to 3%)

- Individuals with acute health care utilization during the study period

- Oral: 54%

- Injectable: 61%

- aOR, 1.34 (95% CI, 0.77 to 2.33)

- Median health care costs

- Oral: $1,630 (IQR, $327–$17,368)

- Injectable: $5,208 ($3,398–$16,849)

- Limitations include:

- Recruitment from a single center and during hospitalization may limit generalizability.

- Alcohol use was self-reported and subject to recall bias.

### Lower the pressure, not the perfusion: intensive BP management after intracerebral hemorrhage

One-Minute Telegram 122-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Intensive blood pressure control improves outcomes after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but its impact on subsequent brain ischemia is unknown. In this prospective randomized trial of intensive (SBP < 140 mm Hg) vs. liberal (SBP < 180 mm Hg) blood pressure control after acute ICH, there were no differences between groups in the number of patients with ischemic lesions, the number of lesions, or the lesion volume on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) performed 48 hours after hemorrhage. This study supports the safety of prompt intensive blood pressure management after acute ICH.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 79 patients aged ≥ 18 years (48% female; mean age, 71 years) with ICH presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset; exclusions included large hematoma volume, Glasgow coma scale score ≤ 5, contraindication to SBP reduction, and planned surgical resection

- Study design: multicenter randomized open-label trial with blinded endpoint assessment

- Setting: 3 comprehensive stroke centers in Canada and Australia

- Intervention: randomized 1:1 to intensive (target SBP < 140 mm Hg within 6 hours) or liberal blood pressure control (target SBP < 180 mm Hg)

- Primary outcome: incidence of acute DWI lesions on brain MRI

- Follow-up: 48 hours

- Main results

- Patients with DWI lesions

- Intensive group: 31%

- Liberal group: 38%

- OR, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.12–4.64)

- There were no differences in the median number of DWI lesions or lesion volume between groups.

- Limitations include:

- Enrollment was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board before the planned sample size of 180 participants was reached after data supporting a target SBP of < 140 mm Hg were published.

- Results may not be generalizable to patients with more severe disease (e.g., larger hematoma volume or more severe neurological symptoms).

### Tecovirimat no better than supportive care for treating mpox

One-Minute Telegram 122-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Tecovirimat, an oral antiviral agent originally developed for the treatment of smallpox, has shown activity against mpox in animal studies. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that tecovirimat plus supportive care was no more effective than placebo plus supportive care in treating patients with clade I MPXV in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Studies assessing the effectiveness of tecovirimat in clade IIb MPXV are ongoing.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 597 patients (49% female; mean age, 16 years; 65% with severe or grave disease) with at least one skin lesion and positive for clade I MPXV on PCR

- Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: 2 general hospitals in the Democratic Republic of Congo

- Intervention: randomized 1:1 to a 14-day course of oral tecovirimat or placebo; all patients received supportive care.

- Primary endpoint: resolution (scabbing or desquamation) of all mpox skin lesions

- Main results

- Median time to lesion resolution

- Tecovirimat: 7 days

- Placebo: 8 days

- HR, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.97–1.31)

- The incidence of adverse and serious adverse events (e.g., death, pregnancy loss) did not differ between groups.

- Lesion resolution was slower in patients with higher baseline lesion count, fever, mouth sores, and high AST levels and/or WBC count.

- Limitations include:

- Lesion resolution is subjective, and lesion stage was not considered.

- Results may not be generalizable to patients with different clades of mpox or other populations.

### Deportations likely to negatively affect already low staffing in the US health care sector

One-Minute Telegram 121-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Health care worker shortages have already significantly limited the operating capacity of US health care settings such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, and home health care. Immigrants make up a sizable proportion of the personnel in these settings. This cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of US health care workers reports that a significant proportion are estimated to hold noncitizen (documented and undocumented) status. The current administration’s deportation plans may exacerbate health care worker shortages, affecting access to health care for many Americans.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: a nationally representative sample of 144,265 respondents to the March 2024 Current Population Survey (CPS), including 8,587 health care workers, corresponding to a weighted n = 20,050,162 individuals classified as health care workers

- Study design: cross-sectional study

- Respondents were asked if they were citizens or noncitizens; the documented status of noncitizens was inferred from the data.

- Analyzed data on:

- Health care employment setting (e.g., outpatient, hospital, nursing home, home care, nonformal health care setting)

- Census region

- Occupation (e.g., physician, registered nurse, nursing aide or assistant, housekeeping or janitorial staff for formal health care sector)

- Country of origin (and eligibility for temporary protected status)

- The weighted n calculation was based on US Census Bureau-supplied weights for national estimates.

- Main results

- The following proportions of all US health care workers were estimated to be immigrants:

- Naturalized citizens: 2,319,224 individuals; 11.6% (95% CI, 10.8–12.4%)

- Documented noncitizens: 697,584 individuals; 3.5% (3.1–3.9%)

- Undocumented immigrants: 366,563 individuals; 1.8% (1.5–2.2%)

- Noncitizen immigrants (documented and undocumented) accounted for 4% of all health care personnel in hospitals and outpatient settings; in all health care settings, this ranged from 4% of all nurses to 19% of all housekeeping and janitorial staff.

- Undocumented immigrants made up a substantial proportion of support staff (e.g., approximately 4% of all nursing aides and assistants and 9% of housekeeping and janitorial staff).

- Limitations include:

- The true proportions of undocumented immigrants and nonformal workers in the health care sector are likely higher than reported because the CPS undercounts these groups.

- CPS-supplied weights may not be accurately representative of different immigration statuses.

- Study funding: none reported

- Original study: Deporting immigrants may further shrink the health care workforce [55]

### Best practice recommendations on the use of cannabis for chronic noncancer pain

One-Minute Telegram 121-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Cannabis is legal for medical use in the majority of US states, and patients often use it to manage chronic noncancer pain, typically accessing it from a medical dispensary with a clinician-signed certification. The American College of Physicians’ Population Health and Medical Science Committee (PHMSC) has developed best practice recommendations on counseling patients who are seeking medical advice on the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic noncancer pain.

## Recommendations breakdown

- Recommendations for patients with chronic noncancer pain include:

- Discussing the potential benefits and risks of using cannabis or cannabinoids

- Informing individuals in certain groups (e.g., aged 10 to 25 years; with substance use history, serious mental illness, or frailty) that risks likely outweigh benefits

- Recommending against use in individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive

- Advising patients not to use inhaled forms of cannabis

- Applicable audience: clinicians counseling patients who are considering cannabinoid-related products for chronic noncancer pain that has not responded to other evidence-based treatments

- Additional information

- Benefits of cannabis use include improvement in:

- Pain rating

- Function

- Disability

- Short-term harms of cannabis include:

- Dizziness

- Sedation

- Nausea

- Long-term harms of cannabis use include:

- Cannabis use disorder

- Cannabis withdrawal syndrome

- Cognitive effects (e.g., effects on verbal learning, working memory)

- Mental health effects (e.g., acute psychosis, psychotic spectrum disorders)

- Physical health effects (e.g., increased risk of testicular germ tumors, hypertension, adverse neonatal outcomes)

- There is stronger evidence to support managing chronic noncancer pain with high THC-CBD ratio preparations compared to low THC-CBD ratio preparations.

- Limitations include:

- As recommendations are based on trials with a relatively short follow-up (several weeks to months), the long-term effects of cannabis use for chronic noncancer pain are unclear.

- Dispensary products have not been studied and typically have a higher THC concentration than the cannabis products used in the studies, many of which (e.g., nabiximols) are not available in the US.

### The weight is over: study shows intermittent fasting beats daily caloric restriction for weight loss

One-Minute Telegram 121-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Intermittent fasting (IMF) is increasingly employed as an alternative weight loss strategy to daily caloric restriction (DCR), but studies assessing the long-term efficacy of IMF on weight loss compared to DCR are lacking. In this randomized controlled trial, IMF was well-tolerated and resulted in significantly greater weight loss than DCR in adults with overweight or obesity over a 12-month period, as part of an intense and comprehensive behavioral weight loss program. Based on these results, IMF is a viable alternative to DCR for weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 165 adults aged 18–60 years (mean age, 42 years; 74% female; 86% White) with BMI 27–46 kg/m2 (mean BMI, 34.1 kg/m2)

- Study design

- Setting: Denver, Colorado, and adjacent metro areas

- Intervention

- 4:3 IMF group: restricted to 20% of normal energy intake on 3 nonconsecutive days per week (no restriction on nonfast days)

- DCR group: 34% reduction of daily energy intake (matching the weekly energy deficit of the 4:3 IMF group)

- Each group was asked to:

- Exercise at moderate intensity for 300 minutes per week

- Partake in a 12-month group-based behavioral weight loss program

- Count calories and log food on energy-deficit days

- Primary outcome: change in body weight at 12 months

- Secondary (cardiometabolic) outcomes included:

- Systolic and diastolic blood pressure

- Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and lipids

- Main results

- Mean weight loss was significantly greater in the 4:3 IMF group than in the DCR group.

- 4:3 IMF group: -7.7 kg (95% CI, -9.6 to -5.9 kg)

- DCR group: -4.8 kg (-6.8 to -2.8 kg)

- Mean difference: 2.89 kg (5.65 to 0.14 kg)

- Secondary outcome findings were not statistically significant but trended toward greater improvements in most cardiometabolic markers for the 4:3 IMF group, although the DCR group showed more favorable changes in diastolic blood pressure and HDL cholesterol.

- The 4:3 IMF group had a greater percentage calorie reduction (-9.8%; -12.8% to -6.7%) than the DCR group (-5.6%; -8.0% to -3.2%) at 12 months.

- Attrition was lower in the 4:3 IMF group (19.0%) than in the DCR group (29.6%).

- Limitations include:

- The study was underpowered to detect differences in the secondary outcome results.

- 24% of participants dropped out of the study.

- Individuals were excluded if they had major physical or psychiatric comorbidities, used weight loss medications, had experienced rapid weight gain, or were pregnant or lactating, limiting generalizability.

### Breathe easier: AI assistance could make lung ultrasound more widely available

One-Minute Telegram 120-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

AI has successfully helped inexperienced sonographers capture high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, but its utility in lung ultrasound (lung US) is unknown. This industry-sponsored, multicenter, diagnostic validation study assessed the impact of AI on the quality of images captured during lung point-of-care US, which is used in the diagnosis and management of dyspnea. Investigators found that, with AI assistance, health care professionals (HCPs) such as nurses, medical assistants, and phlebotomists with minimal lung US training could capture lung US images of comparable or better diagnostic quality than those captured by lung US experts. AI-assistance could bring lung US to underserved areas without skilled technicians.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 176 adults ≥ 21 years of age (54% male; mean age, 63 years; 51% Black or African American, 42% White) undergoing assessment for pulmonary edema

- Study design: comparative diagnostic validation study

- Setting: 1 outpatient cardiac clinic, 1 inpatient site, and 2 emergency departments

- Intervention: 2 lung US examinations performed within 1 hour of each other

- AI-assisted (using Lung Guidance AI software): performed by an HCP (e.g., nurse, medical assistant, phlebotomist) with little previous lung US experience who had 2.5 hours of supervised practice with the software (n = 17) or by a physician with previous US experience (n = 4)

- Reference standard: performed by an expert lung sonographer without AI assistance

- Outcome: percentage of diagnostic-quality lung US images as independently assessed by 5 masked experts

- Main results

- 98.3% (95% CI, 95.1–99.4%) of AI-assisted lung US images were of diagnostic quality.

- No significant difference in the percentage of diagnostic-quality lung US images between groups (P = 0.45)

- AI-assisted nonphysician HCPs: 97.8% (95% CI, 93.8–99.3%)

- AI-assisted physicians: 100% (90.8–100%)

- Lung US experts: 96.6% (92.8–98.4%)

- When US images from 8 specific lung zones were assessed:

- AI-assisted nonphysician HCPs performed as well as or better than lung US experts.

- AI-assisted physicians outperformed the other groups in 3/8 zones.

- Limitations include:

- The study focused on the quality of lung US images captured, and does not provide information about the diagnostic accuracy of AI-assisted lung US.

- There was no control group of HCPs with minimal US experience performing lung US without AI assistance.

### Automated insulin delivery systems sweeten blood glucose management

One-Minute Telegram 120-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems use continuous glucose monitoring data to deliver insulin subcutaneously when it is needed; the safety and efficacy of AID systems have been demonstrated in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). In this industry-sponsored, multicenter, randomized comparative trial, patients with insulin-treated type 2 DM using an AID system had a greater decrease in HbA1c level after 13 weeks (0.9%) than those using insulin injections or an insulin pump (0.3%). Not quite an artificial pancreas, but AID systems are an effective way to manage blood glucose levels quickly and in real time for people with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 DM.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 319 adults with type 2 DM who had been treated with insulin for ≥ 3 months (4% used an insulin pump, 71% used continuous glucose monitoring)

- Study design: multicenter randomized comparative trial

- Setting: 21 medical centers in the US and Canada

- Intervention: AID system (n = 215) vs. continuing pretrial insulin delivery method plus continuous glucose monitoring (control group; n = 104)

- Primary outcome: HbA1c level

- Follow-up: 13 weeks

- Main results

- HbA1c level decreased in both groups.

- AID: -0.9% (from 8.2±1.4% to 7.3±0.9%)

- Control: -0.3% (from 8.1±1.2% to 7.7±1.1%)

- Adjusted mean difference, -0.6% (95% CI, -0.8 to -0.4%)

- Adverse effects

- One participant in the AID group experienced a severe hypoglycemic event.

- Mean weight gain from baseline was higher in the AID group (2.4±4.4 kg) than in the control group (0.9±3.3 kg): adjusted mean difference, 1.5 kg (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.5 kg).

- Limitations include:

- Short follow-up duration

- Restricted to patients already using insulin

- Study funding: Tandem Diabetes Care; Novo Nordisk provided insulin aspart; continuous glucose monitors purchased at a discounted price from Dexcom

- Original study: A randomized trial of automated insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes [59]

### D-fence against MS: vitamin D reduces MS disease activity

One-Minute Telegram 120-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which is a single episode of neurological symptoms resulting from central nervous system demyelination (e.g., optic neuritis, transverse myelitis), is often the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). This randomized clinical trial investigated if high-dose vitamin D (100,000 IU cholecalciferol every 2 weeks) administered to patients within 90 days of CIS could prevent subsequent MS disease activity. Participants receiving vitamin D had lower rates of clinical manifestations and MRI activity indicative of MS during the 24-month follow-up period compared to those receiving a placebo. Although data are preliminary, high-dose vitamin D may be a useful adjunctive treatment to decrease MS disease activity following CIS.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 303 adults (median age, 34 years; 70% female) with the following

- CIS within the previous 90 days

- Lesions in multiple central nervous system areas (dissemination in space) on MRI OR ≥ 2 lesions on MRI and oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid

- Serum vitamin D level < 100 nmol/L

- Study design: multicenter randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial

- Setting: 36 MS centers in France

- Intervention: oral cholecalciferol 100,000 IU every 2 weeks vs. placebo for 24 months or until evidence of disease activity

- Outcome: disease activity, defined as a relapse and/or MRI activity (new or contrast-enhancing lesions)

- Follow-up at 3, 12, and 24 months, and if relapse occurred; included:

- Neurological assessment and MRI

- Serum and urinary calcium levels

- Renal function tests

- Main results

- Evidence of disease activity: 94 participants (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 (74.1%) in the control group; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.5–0.87)

- Relapse: 28 (17.9%) in the vitamin D group and 32 (21.8%) in the control group; aHR, 0.69 (0.42–1.16)

- MRI activity: 89 (57.1%) in the vitamin D group and 96 (65.3%) in the control group; aHR, 0.71 (0.53–0.95)

- Median time to disease activity

- Vitamin D: 432 days (95% CI, 360–727 days)

- Control: 224 days (104–360 days)

- Number needed to treat for prevention of disease activity: 7.2 (95% CI, 4.1–29.0)

- No vitamin D-related serious adverse events were reported.

- Limitations include:

- Criteria for diagnosing MS were updated during the study period; a subgroup of participants (n = 247) met criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at study baseline, before treatment began.

- An additional 19 participants had evidence of MS disease activity at baseline and were inappropriately started on treatment.

### Edition 119 - March 29, 2025

### Want to increase vaccination rates? Talk to your patients!

One-Minute Telegram 119-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Vaccine hesitancy is increasingly recognized as a public health threat in both medical literature and the media, but which interventions improve vaccination uptake remains unclear. In this systematic review of 44 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), face-to-face conversations between patients and health care providers and bundled interventions resulted in the greatest increase in vaccination rates; isolated electronic health record (EHR) reminders resulted in the smallest increase. Outpatient primary care clinics should consider bundled interventions to address vaccine hesitancy, ideally with opportunities for face-to-face conversations.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 44 RCTs that assessed interventions aimed at increasing adult vaccination rates

- Study design: systematic review of previously published RCTs

- Eligible studies:

- Conducted interventions only in an outpatient primary care setting

- Included only nonpregnant adults

- Addressed only standard adult vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcus, hepatitis B, tetanus, herpes zoster, COVID-19)

- Interventions involved single or bundled activities targeting clinicians, patients, or both, e.g.:

- Patient and/or clinician education about vaccines

- Reminders to order vaccines (clinicians) or to be vaccinated (patients)

- Increasing vaccine access (e.g., standing vaccination orders, vaccine clinics, reducing vaccine cost, nurse home visits)

- Interventions included face-to-face discussions with patients, EHR reminders, and new opportunities to administer vaccinations.

- Primary outcome: vaccination rates following intervention compared to historical rates or rates following usual care

- Main results

- RCTs were heterogeneous.

- Single intervention not involving face-to-face contact with patients: 24 trials

- Bundled interventions: 9 trials

- Intervention involving face-to-face contact: number not specified

- Seven different vaccines or combinations of vaccines were studied.

- The increase in vaccination rate from baseline varied by intervention.

- Reminding clinicians to order vaccines: 4–32%

- EHR prompts: 1–16%

- Bundled interventions: 4–42%

- Intervention with face-to-face patient contact

- Group outpatient visits: 13–17%

- Home visits: 6–17%

- Provider recommendation: 15%

- Limitations include:

- Most RCTs had a high or unclear bias, which may have positively biased the results.

- Reported interventions were often vague and not easily reproducible, limiting generalizability.

- The effectiveness of individual components in bundled interventions was not reported, limiting the ability to analyze individual components in aggregate.

- Study funding: None

### Nirsevimab is the real-world deal for reducing RSV severity in infants

One-Minute Telegram 119-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Passive immunization of infants with nirsevimab has been shown to reduce the severity of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (RSV-LRTI) in clinical trials, but real-world effectiveness remains unproven. In this national population-based cohort study conducted in France, passive immunization with a single dose of nirsevimab reduced the incidence of RSV-LRTI-related hospitalization, oxygen therapy, and ventilation support in infants compared to no immunization. Passive immunization of infants with nirsevimab is a pivotal population-based strategy for reducing the severity of RSV-LRTI, which is the leading cause of hospitalization for respiratory illness in this age group.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 82,474 infants born between February 6 and September 15, 2023, who were eligible to receive nirsevimab (53% male; 95% born at term)

- Study design: national population-based cohort study using a target trial emulation framework

- Setting: mainland France (data collected from the French National Health Data System)

- Each infant who received nirsevimab in an outpatient setting was matched 1:1 with an unimmunized infant based on sex, birth month, gestational age, and socioeconomic status (SES).

- Exposure: immunization with a single dose of nirsevimab (weight < 5 kg: 50 mg IM; weight ≥ 5 kg: 100 mg IM) vs. no immunization

- Primary efficacy outcome: hospitalization for RSV-LRTI

- Secondary efficacy outcome: hospitalization for either RSV-specific or non-pathogen-coded LRTI

- Other secondary outcomes included RSV-LRTI that required ≥ 1 of the following:

- PICU admission

- High dependency unit (HDU) admission

- Ventilation support (invasive and noninvasive)

- Oxygen therapy

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 118 days

- Total hospitalizations for RSV-LRTI

- Nirsevimab group: 342 (0.8%)

- Unimmunized group: 992 (2.4%)

- Effectiveness of nirsevimab for the prevention of RSV-LRTI-related secondary outcomes

- Hospitalization: 65% (95% CI, 61–69%)

- PICU admission: 74% (56–85%)

- HDU admission: 64% (55–71%)

- Ventilation support: 66% (51–76%)

- Oxygen therapy: 67% (57–75%)

- Effectiveness of nirsevimab for the prevention of hospitalization for either RSV-LRTI or non-pathogen-coded LRTI: 53% (48–57%)

- Limitations include:

- Effectiveness assessments may have been affected by low nirsevimab uptake in the 2023–2024 season due to drug shortages.

- Most infants in this study received nirsevimab before RSV season; results may not be generalizable to infants who receive nirsevimab during RSV season.

- Infants born into families with higher SES were more likely to receive nirsevimab than those born into families with lower SES, which may have led to confounding.

- Study funding: None

### Long-acting ART: a good choice for individuals with HIV viremia?

One-Minute Telegram 119-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) with cabotegravir/rilpivirine is approved for individuals with HIV with viral suppression from the use of oral ART, but studies on the use of LA-ART in individuals with viremia are lacking. In this cohort study in a single HIV clinic in San Francisco, the percentage of individuals with viral suppression after 48 weeks of LA-ART was high in both those with viremia at therapy initiation (98%) and those without viremia at initiation (99%). Individuals with HIV viremia and adherence challenges with daily ART may benefit from LA-ART as an alternative to oral ART.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 370 adults with HIV receiving LA-ART (median age, 44 years; 80% cisgender men, 4% cisgender women, 10% transgender women)

- Study design: cohort study

- Setting: single HIV clinic in San Francisco, CA

- Exposure: presence vs. absence of HIV viremia (viremia defined as HIV RNA level ≥ 30 copies/mL) at LA-ART initiation

- Outcome: percentage of individuals with viral suppression (HIV RNA level < 30 copies/mL)

- Follow-up: 48 weeks

- Main results

- At therapy initiation, 129 individuals had detectable viremia and 241 did not have detectable viremia.

- The percentage of individuals with viral suppression after 24 and 48 weeks of LA-ART was similar in those with and without viremia at initiation.

- 24 weeks: 97% (CI 93–100%) of individuals with viremia vs. 99% (99–100%) without viremia

- 48 weeks: 98% (93–99%) of individuals with viremia vs. 99% (97–100%) without viremia

- Median time to undetectable viral load in individuals with viremia at initiation: 32 days (30–45 days)

- Limitations include:

- As data was collected from a single center, results might not be generalizable to populations in other regions or HIV clinics.

- The observational nature of the study limits the ability to establish causality.

### Edition 118 - March 15, 2025

### Human vs. machine: a diagnostic draw

One-Minute Telegram 118-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Computerized diagnostic decision support systems (CDDSSs), which use patient data and algorithms to assist clinicians in diagnosis, have shown potential in vignette and retrospective studies. In this multicenter Swiss study, adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with select diagnostically challenging symptoms (nontraumatic abdominal pain, fever of unknown origin, syncope, nonspecific symptoms) were randomized to usual care or CDDSS-assisted evaluation, with no difference in diagnostic quality. These findings reinforce the growing body of evidence that CDDSSs may not improve diagnostic accuracy in real-world acute care settings.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1204 adults (median age 53 years, 51% female) presenting to the ED with nontraumatic abdominal pain, fever of unknown origin, syncope, or nonspecific symptoms (e.g., malaise, weakness, dizziness)

- Study design: multicenter, cluster-randomized crossover trial

- Setting: 4 emergency departments in Switzerland

- Intervention: diagnosis made with the support of a CDDSS (DDX-BRO; n = 559) compared to diagnosis without (usual care; n = 645)

- Primary outcome: risk to diagnostic quality determined by any of the following

- Unscheduled medical care

- Change in diagnosis

- Unexpected ICU transfer within 24 hours of ED presentation

- Death

- Follow-up: 14 days after ED discharge

- Main results

- No difference in the primary outcome between the intervention and usual care groups

- Risk to diagnostic quality: CDDSS 18% vs. usual care 18% (aOR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71–1.30)

- Unscheduled medical care: CDDSS 12% vs. usual care 11% (aOR 1.21; 0.84–1.74)

- Change in diagnosis: CDDSS 7% vs. usual care 9% (aOR 0.73; 0.47–1.13)

- Death and unscheduled intensive care admission were rare in both groups.

- Limitations include:

- Treating physicians could not be blinded to intervention.

- Results may not be generalizable to patient populations with different presentations.

- The benefit of CDDSS in settings where individual clinicians are responsible for decision-making may have been underestimated because patient cases were discussed among multiple health care providers (e.g., resident and attending physicians) at the participating sites.

### Yellow fever vaccine: less is equal

One-Minute Telegram 118-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Yellow fever is endemic in much of South America and Africa; a single dose of live attenuated yellow fever vaccine provides lifelong protection, but the supply is limited. The Noninferiority Fractional-Doses Trial for Yellow Fever Vaccine (NIFTY) compared seroconversion rates of three fractional doses of yellow fever vaccine to the standard dose using noninferiority analysis. The 1000 IU and 500 IU doses were found to be noninferior to the standard dose of vaccine in adults in Uganda and Kenya in terms of both seroconversion and persistent immunity at 2 years. These results may support a public health approach that significantly stretches the limited supply of yellow fever vaccine.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 480 adults aged 18–59 years (mean age 39.7 years, 62% women, 8% HIV positive) with no history of yellow fever vaccination or infection

- Study design: double-blind, randomized noninferiority trial

- Setting: 2 clinical trial research centers in Uganda and Kenya or a fractional dose of 1000 IU, 500 IU, or 250 IU.

- Primary outcome: seroconversion 28 days after vaccination (defined as antibody titer ≥ 4 times higher than baseline)

- Additional assessments include: antibody titers 1 and 2 years after vaccination, postvaccination viremia

- Follow-up: 2 years

- Main results

- For the primary outcome, all fractional doses were noninferior to the standard dose in the intention-to-treat analysis; 500 IU and 1000 IU doses were noninferior in the per-protocol analysis.

- Intention-to-treat analysis

- Seroconversion at day 28

- Standard dose: 98% (95% CI, 94–100%)

- 1000 IU and 500 IU: 98% (94–100%)

- 250 IU: 94% (88–97%)

- Difference in seroconversion between fractional and standard dose at day 28

- 1000 IU: 0.01% (95% CI, -5.0 to 5.1%)

- 500 IU: 0.01% (-5.0 to 5.1%)

- 250 IU: -4.4% (-9.4 to 0.7%)

- Difference in seroconversion between fractional and standard dose at 1 year

- 1000 IU: -1.8% (95% CI, -7.5 to 4.0%)

- 500 IU: -1.7% (-7.4 to 4.0%)

- 250 IU: -7.1% (-12.8 to -1.3%)

- Difference in seroconversion between fractional and standard dose at 2 years

- 1000 IU: -4.8% (95% CI, -13.9 to 4.3%)

- 500 IU: -2.7% (-11.7 to 6.3%)

- 250 IU: -11.6% (-20.6 to -2.6%)

- Three severe vaccine-related adverse events were reported.

- Limitations include:

- 35 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis were found to have baseline antibodies for a new yellow fever variant, which may have affected the determination of seroconversion in those participants.

- Immunity beyond 2 years was not assessed.

- Results may not be generalizable to regions with different yellow fever substrains.

- The study did not include participants below the age of 18.

### Vitamin D supplementation no defense against acute respiratory infections

One-Minute Telegram 118-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), and an earlier meta-analysis found that vitamin D supplementation is modestly effective in preventing ARIs. However, this updated systematic review and meta-analysis by the same group found that vitamin D supplementation does not protect against ARIs compared to placebo. While individuals with vitamin D deficiency should receive vitamin D supplementation, it is unlikely that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in preventing ARIs.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 46 randomized controlled trials including participants (n = 64,068) of any age from 24 countries

- Study design: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

- Intervention: supplementation with vitamin D3, vitamin D2, or 25(OH)D, compared to placebo or to lower-dose vitamin D supplementation

- Outcomes

- Primary: incidence of ARIs

- Secondary (placebo-controlled trials only)

- Incidence of upper and lower respiratory infections

- Emergency department visit and/or hospital admission for ARIs

- Work or school absences for ARIs

- Use of antibiotics for ARIs

- Adverse reactions to vitamin D

- Serious adverse events, including death

- Study duration: 7 weeks to 5 years

- Main results

- Vitamin D supplementation did not affect ARI risk compared to placebo (OR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.00).

- Higher-dose vitamin D did not affect ARI risk compared to lower-dose vitamin D (OR 0.87; 0.73–1.04).

- Baseline vitamin D status and previous diagnosis of asthma or COPD did not change the outcome.

- Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups.

- Limitations include:

- Some trials did not provide data for meta-analysis; at least one such trial reported a protective effect of vitamin D.

- Individual participant data was not analyzed; analysis was at the trial level, which may obscure within-trial variability and limit the ability to conduct subgroup analyses and/or adjust for confounders.

- Only a few studies examined lower-dose vs. higher-dose vitamin D.

### Expanding options for medication abortion

One-Minute Telegram 117-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Induced abortion using a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is safe and highly effective up to 77 days’ gestation; however, in many regions, mifepristone is expensive and availability is limited. In this two-stage clinical study, a medication abortion regimen combining the emergency contraceptive ulipristal acetate with misoprostol was shown to be effective and deemed acceptable to study participants. Larger, randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings and further elucidate the role of ulipristal in medication abortion.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: adults (≥ 18 years) with an intrauterine pregnancy seeking abortion before 64 days’ gestation and a BMI ≤ 32 kg/m2

- Study design: two-stage proof-of-concept study

- Stage 1: preparatory dose-finding study

- Randomized, open-label trial

- 66 participants were randomized 1:1 to 60 mg or 90 mg ulipristal, followed by 800 mcg misoprostol.

- Both doses of ulipristal had comparable safety and efficacy profiles.

- Stage 2: single-arm trial

- Intervention: An additional 100 participants received 60 mg ulipristal PO once, followed by 800 mcg misoprostol PO 24 hours later, and pain management with 400 mg ibuprofen PO as needed.

- Primary outcome: complete abortion without the need for additional management (i.e., expectant management, additional medication, or uterine evacuation) in the 133 participants who received 60 mg ulipristal across stages 1 and 2

- Secondary outcomes

- Participant satisfaction

- Pain score

- Post-treatment follow-up: 7–10 days

- Pelvic ultrasound to assess pregnancy status

- Structured questionnaire to assess acceptability

- Setting: outpatient reproductive health clinic in Mexico City

- Main results

- Primary outcome

- Complete abortion at follow-up: 129/133 participants (97%; 95% CI, 94.1–99.9%)

- 4 participants required additional management at follow-up: 3 (2.3%) with ongoing pregnancy and 1 (0.8%) with incomplete abortion and bleeding.

- 3 participants experienced adverse events, but none were serious.

- Acceptability outcomes

- Satisfaction: 130/133 participants (97.7%; 95% CI, 95.2–100%) were satisfied or very satisfied; no participants were unsatisfied.

- Pain acceptability

- Median pain score: 8 (IQR, 6–9)

- 113/133 participants (85%; 78.9–91%) found the pain acceptable or very acceptable; 8 (6%; 2–10.1%) considered it unacceptable or very unacceptable.

- Limitations include:

- The small sample size limits the ability to assess safety.

- Stage 2 was originally planned as a noninferiority trial with historical controls who received misoprostol monotherapy. The trial was not conducted, preventing direct efficacy comparisons.

- The study population was drawn from one health center in one geographic area, limiting generalizability.

- Study funding: OPTions Initiative

- Original study: A proof-of-concept study of ulipristal acetate for early medication abortion [67]

### Avian influenza: rising cases (and egg prices) but no evidence of human-to-human transmission

One-Minute Telegram 117-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Avian influenza A(H5N1) has been causing widespread infection in US poultry and cows; before 2024, only 1 human case had been identified in the US. This case series describes the 46 human cases of H5N1 identified in the US since March 2024. Almost all patients were exposed to infected poultry or cows, and no human-to-human transmission was confirmed. The illness was mild (the most common symptom was conjunctivitis), and detection rates were highest with conjunctival swabs. Providers should consider collecting conjunctival specimens in addition to respiratory specimens to more accurately identify patients with H5N1 infection.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 46 individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H5N1) infection

- Study design: descriptive case series

- Setting: routine influenza surveillance conducted by state and local public health departments between March and October 2024

- Case identification

- Individuals with occupational exposure to animals with known or suspected H5N1 infection were monitored for symptoms for 10 days after exposure.

- Routine surveillance for novel influenza A

- Outcomes

- Case characteristics were collected using standardized case report forms.

- Specimens were sent to the CDC for testing using real-time RT-PCR and genetic sequencing for H5N1.

- Main results

- 46 patients with H5N1 infection were identified.

- 25 patients were exposed to infected cows.

- 20 were exposed to infected poultry.

- 1 had no known exposure.

- Disease course

- Illness was mild: No patients became critically ill or died, but no patients were asymptomatic.

- Conjunctivitis was the most common symptom (93%), followed by fever (49%) and respiratory symptoms (36%).

- Median duration: 4 days

- Diagnostics

- Overall, detection rates were highest with conjunctival swabs (88%), followed by combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (41%) and nasopharyngeal swabs (33%).

- Patients with conjunctivitis: Conjunctival swabs were positive in 90% of samples.

- Patients with respiratory symptoms: Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive in 45% of samples, and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs were positive in 56%.

### Liraglutide: weight-loss drugs for children?

One-Minute Telegram 117-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Liraglutide is FDA-approved for the treatment of obesity in children ≥ 12 years of age, but its safety and efficacy in younger children is unknown. This pharmaceutical industry-sponsored randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that in children aged 6–11 years, liraglutide combined with lifestyle modifications was more effective for weight loss than placebo combined with lifestyle modifications. However, just like adults, children regained weight after liraglutide was stopped. While liraglutide may become part of the toolkit for childhood obesity, it’s unclear whether it’s a game-changer or just a short-term solution.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 82 children (aged 6–11 years) with obesity

- Study design: randomized, double-blind phase 3 placebo-controlled trial

- Setting: 23 clinical trial sites in 9 countries

- Intervention: liraglutide 3 mg subcutaneously once daily or placebo, plus lifestyle modifications for 56 weeks

- Primary endpoint: percentage change in BMI from baseline to week 56

- Safety endpoints: rates of adverse events and serious adverse events

- Post-treatment follow-up: 26 weeks

- Main results

- Primary endpoint: BMI decreased 5.8% in the liraglutide group and increased 1.6% in the placebo group (mean difference, -7.4%; 95% CI, -11.6 to -3.2%).

- ≥ 5% reduction in BMI was seen in:

- 46% in the liraglutide group

- 9% in the placebo group (adjusted OR, 6.3; 1.4 to 28.8)

- At the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (week 82), both groups had gained weight; mean change in BMI from baseline was:

- -0.8% in the liraglutide group

- 6.7% in the placebo group

- Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups; gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events.

- Limitations include:

- There is a lack of consensus on meaningful weight loss in children.

- Most participants (70%) were White, limiting the generalizability of the results.

- Long-term safety and efficacy studies are needed.

### Valentine’s Day edition

One-Minute Telegram 116-2025-1/3

- Love bytes: the sweet and strange world of AI relationships. Valentine’s Day may be over, but romance is still very much AI-live. A study of over 35,000 AI chatbot users revealed that people are forming emotional connections with their digital friends (or more than friends). From heartfelt chats to playful role-play, these AI BFFs bring joy, love, and laughter. But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. While users love to morph chatbots into ideal companions, virtual intimacy can take an unsettling turn when feelings bounce back across the uncanny valley and you realize you’ve fallen for beautifully scripted code.

So, whether you spent February 14th with your soulmate, solo, or swapping Valentine’s wishes with a bot, one thing is clear: AI is staking its claim as the low-maintenance date of the future. Too bad it can’t pick up the check...

### Sepsis immunotherapy: thymosin α1 falls short, but could some still benefit?

One-Minute Telegram 116-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy is a promising candidate for improving sepsis outcomes by targeting immune dysregulation and immunosuppression. Previous small studies have suggested that the immunomodulator thymosin α1 may reduce mortality in patients with sepsis. However, in this large double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of sepsis in China, treatment with thymosin α1 did not reduce 28-day all-cause mortality compared to placebo, although potential differential effects were noted in older adults and patients with diabetes. Studies targeting selected patient groups may better elucidate the role of immunomodulatory therapy in sepsis.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 1106 adults aged 18–85 years (median age, 65 years; 69% male) diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 criteria

- Study design: multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial

- Setting: 22 medical centers in China between September 2016 and December 2020

- Intervention: subcutaneous injection of 1.6 mg thymosin α1 or placebo every 12 hours for 7 days (in addition to standard treatment)

- Primary outcome: 28-day all-cause mortality (modified intention-to-treat analysis)

- Secondary outcomes included:

- 90-day all-cause mortality

- Changes in sequential organ failure assessment score on day 7

- Mechanical ventilation-free days within 28 days

- Continuous renal replacement therapy-free days within 28 days

- Vasopressor-free days within 28 days

- Follow-up: 90 days

- Main results

- No overall effect on the primary outcome, which occurred in 127 participants (23.4%) in the thymosin α1 group and 132 (24.1%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.99; 95% Cl, 0.77–1.27)

- In subgroup analyses, there was a potential differential effect.

- Thymosin α1 appeared protective in individuals with diabetes (HR, 0.58; 0.35–0.99) but had no significant effect in those without diabetes (HR, 1.16; 0.87–1.53): P for interaction = 0.04.

- Thymosin α1 showed a potentially harmful effect in individuals aged < 60 years (HR, 1.67; 1.04–2.67) but not in those aged ≥ 60 years (HR, 0.81; 0.61–1.09): P for interaction = 0.01. However, in a post hoc analysis, no harmful effect was seen after adjusting for organ support before randomization.

- Secondary and safety outcomes: no significant differences between groups

- Limitations include:

- Observed mortality rates (∼ 24%) were lower than hypothesized (35%), suggesting sicker patients with greater immune dysregulation were underrepresented.

- The study may have been underpowered based on the projected difference of 8% between the intervention and placebo groups.

- Timing from sepsis onset to randomization was uncertain. Most patients had multiple immune marker abnormalities at randomization, suggesting that treatment may not have been initiated early enough.

### ADHD linked to shorter life expectancy

One-Minute Telegram 116-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been linked to poor health outcomes and an increased risk of premature death, but data on life expectancy deficits in individuals with ADHD is lacking. In this cohort study, mortality data from a national UK database showed that individuals diagnosed with ADHD had a significantly shorter life expectancy than matched controls. Further studies are needed to identify modifiable risk factors for premature death in this population.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: identified from 9,561,450 people in 792 general care practices

- Exposed group: 30,039 adults aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with ADHD (21.82% female; median age at cohort entry, 18.95 years for male individuals and 22.10 years for female individuals)

- Comparison group: 300,390 adults matched by age, sex, and primary care practice

- Study design: matched retrospective cohort study

- Setting: UK electronic primary care health records from IQVIA Medical Research Data from 2000 to 2019

- Exposure: ADHD diagnosis

- Outcome: all-cause death

- Data on baseline comorbidities and variables included:

- Socioeconomic deprivation

- Physical health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)

- Mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression)

- Neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism, intellectual disability)

- Substance use (e.g., tobacco, alcohol)

- Main results

- Mortality rates were higher in adults with ADHD than in controls.

- Male individuals: 0.83% vs. 0.52%

- Female individuals: 2.22% vs. 1.35%

- ADHD was associated with a significant reduction in apparent life expectancy compared to controls.

- Male individuals: -6.78 years (95% CI, -9.11 to -4.50)

- Female individuals: -8.64 years (-10.91 to -6.55)

- Rates of all baseline comorbidities and variables were higher in adults with ADHD than in controls.

- Limitations include:

- The ADHD group may not have accurately represented all adults with ADHD, as it is estimated that only 1 in 9 adults with ADHD are diagnosed.

- Individuals with comorbidities may have been overrepresented in the ADHD group, as more health care contacts may have increased ADHD diagnosis rates, potentially leading to an overestimation of mortality in this group.

- Years of life lost could not be attributed to specific causes, as data on cause of death was not available.

- Race, ethnicity, and gender diversity were not accounted for and may have led to confounding.

### Morning coffee: think fast, live long!

One-Minute Telegram 115-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Coffee, the world’s most popular psychoactive stimulant, lowers the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and death, but does the time of consumption matter? In this observational study, drinking coffee only in the morning was associated with decreased all-cause mortality and CVD-specific mortality compared to coffee abstinence. There was no difference in mortality between those drinking coffee all day and those abstaining from coffee. Coffee consumption late in the day may interfere with the body’s natural circadian rhythms, reducing coffee’s anti-inflammatory effects, but more research is needed to demonstrate this causality.
“Without my morning coffee, I’m just like a dried-up piece of roast goat.” - Johann Sebastian Bach

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 40,725 US adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2018

- Study design: observational cohort study

- Timing of coffee consumption was determined using self-reported dietary recall.

- Clustering analysis was used to identify coffee drinking patterns (for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee).

- Non-coffee drinkers

- Morning type: consumption from 4 a.m. to 11:59 a.m.

- All-day type: consumption throughout the day

- Death and death rate information were obtained from the National Death Index until the end of 2019.

- Outcomes

- All-cause mortality

- CVD-specific mortality

- Cancer-specific mortality

- Main results

- All-cause mortality

- The morning-type group had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than non-coffee drinkers (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81–0.96).

- All-cause mortality was lowest in those who consumed 2–3 cups of coffee per day in the morning (HR, 0.71; 0.60–0.86).

- The risk of all-cause mortality was similar in the all-day-type group and non-coffee drinkers (HR, 0.99; 0.9–1.10).

- Cause-specific mortality

- The morning-type group had a lower risk of CVD-specific mortality than non-coffee drinkers (HR, 0.69; 0.55–0.87) but similar rates of cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.97; 0.75–1.25).

- The risk of CVD-specific and cancer-specific mortality was similar in the all-day-type group and non-coffee drinkers.

- Similar associations were observed for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee drinking.

- Limitations include:

- Results were based on self-reporting, which is subject to recall bias.

- Morning-type coffee consumption may be a marker of unmeasured confounding variables (e.g., regular work hours, healthy lifestyle).

### Bone up on the updated USPSTF recommendations for osteoporosis screening to prevent fragility fractures

One-Minute Telegram 115-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

Osteoporosis occurs in over 25% of women in the US aged 65 years and older and is associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures, often accompanied by secondary complications. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends osteoporosis screening for all women 65 years of age and older and for younger postmenopausal women with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis to prevent fragility fractures. There are no recommendations for screening for osteoporosis in men. In a separate statement, the USPSTF also provides recommendations for the prevention of falls in older adults to further reduce the risk of fragility fractures.

## Recommendations breakdown

- Recommendations

- Screen all women 65 years of age and older for osteoporosis.

- Screen postmenopausal women younger than 65 years of age if they have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis.

- Applicable population: adults ≥ 40 years of age without known osteoporosis, history of a fragility fracture, or risk factors for secondary osteoporosis (e.g., chronic glucocorticoid use)

- Rationale: The USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures has moderate net benefit.

- Implementation

- Women ≥ 65 years of age

- Obtain dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

- In addition, consider using a fracture risk assessment tool (e.g., FRAX, Fracture Risk Calculator).

- Postmenopausal women < 65 years of age

- Assess for risk factors for osteoporosis.

- If ≥ 1 risk factors are present, use a risk assessment tool (e.g., Osteoporosis Risk

- Assessment Instrument, FRAX).

- If risk is increased, follow the screening protocol for women ≥ 65 years of age.

- Additional information

- Risk factors for osteoporosis in this recommendation are:

- Low BMI

- Parental history of hip fracture

- Excess alcohol consumption

- Current cigarette smoking

- Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of osteoporosis screening in men.

### Sharing isn’t always caring: preventing TB transmission with levofloxacin

One-Minute Telegram 115-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Every year, half a million people develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but little is known about how to prevent transmission to close contacts. In this meta-analysis of two phase 3 trials, individuals taking daily levofloxacin had a 60% lower risk of contracting TB from a household contact with MDR-TB than those taking a placebo. Low-grade musculoskeletal events more frequently occurred in the levofloxacin group than in the placebo group; there was no association between levofloxacin and severe adverse events (AEs). Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration and cost-effectiveness of levofloxacin prophylaxis.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 2963 individuals with household exposure to MDR-TB or rifampin-resistant TB and evidence of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, HIV infection, or (in the Vietnam study only) severe malnutrition

- Study design: combined analysis of two randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trials

- Study 1: Vietnam Quinolones for MDR-TB (VQUIN)

- Primarily included adults in Vietnam

- 2041 participants (median age, 40 years)

- Study 2: Tuberculosis Child Multidrug-resistant Preventive Therapy (TB-CHAMP)

- Children in South Africa

- Initially limited to children < 5 years of age but later expanded to children ≤ 17 years of age

- 922 participants (median age, 2.8 years)

- Main results

- Incidence of TB at 54 weeks was lower in the levofloxacin group than in the placebo group (relative difference in cumulative incidence, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18–0.92).

- NNT to prevent one case of TB at 54 weeks

- VQUIN: 193 (95% CI, 98–5158)

- TB-CHAMP: 56 (30–466)

- The incidence of severe AEs was similar in the levofloxacin and placebo groups (risk ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.7–1.65).

- The risk of developing musculoskeletal AEs was significantly higher in the levofloxacin group than in the placebo group (risk ratio, 6.36; 4.3–9.42).

- 97% were nonsevere (grade 1 or 2) AEs.

- The association was not seen in children < 10 years of age.

- Limitations include:

- Results are not generalizable to all high-risk groups.

- Genotyping was not used to establish whether new cases of TB were contracted from the household contact or another source.

- Other factors that could influence treatment efficacy (e.g., geographical setting) were not considered.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for long COVID: a small but meaningful step?

One-Minute Telegram 114-2025-1/3

## 10-second takeaway

Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is an often debilitating complication of COVID-19 infection, but evidence-based management for PCC is limited. In this randomized clinical trial, patients with mild to moderate PCC participating in an outpatient rehabilitation program using a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach had significantly better physical functioning than those receiving usual care, with a small to moderate effect size. Clinicians may consider referral to outpatient CBT for certain patients with PCC depending on implementation feasibility and patient preference.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 314 individuals aged ≥ 16 years (mean age, 43 years; 72% female) with mild to moderate PCC

- Study design: pragmatic randomized clinical trial

- Setting: single outpatient referral center clinic in Norway between February 2022 and April 2024

- Intervention: Participants were randomized 1:1 to either usual care or an outpatient rehabilitation program consisting of visits every 2–6 weeks (total 2–8 visits) based on a cognitive and behavioral approach.

- Primary outcome

- Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Function Subscale (SF-36-PFS) scores between enrollment (T0) and immediately after intervention completion (T1)

- Higher scores indicate better physical functioning.

- Secondary outcomes included:

- SF-36-PFS score 12 months after enrollment (T2)

- Symptom scores (e.g., for cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, bodily pain, and smell and taste abnormalities)

- Safety outcomes included:

- Contact with primary health care services

- Hospital admissions

- Occurrence of new disease

- Follow-up: 12 months

- Main results

- Primary outcome

- Improvement in SF-36-PFS at T1 was significantly greater in the intervention group vs. the usual care group (score difference, 9.2; 95% CI, 4.3–14.2).

- The effect size was small to moderate (Cohen’s d = 0.43).

- Secondary outcomes

- SF-36-PFS at T2 was sustained, favoring the intervention group.

- Except smell and taste abnormalities and bodily pain, all secondary outcome measures at T2 (and most at T1) favored the intervention group over the usual care group, with small to moderate effect sizes.

- Safety outcomes: Self-reported health statuses at T1 and T2 were better in the intervention group than in the usual care group for most items, except hospital admissions and new disease occurrence at T2.

- Limitations include:

- Blinding was not possible, potentially leading to the placebo effect.

- Participants had only moderate impairment, and results may not be generalizable to patients with severe PCC.

### Less frequent breast cancer screening does not correlate with higher breast cancer stage at diagnosis

One-Minute Telegram 114-2025-2/3

## 10-second takeaway

In 2009, the USPSTF recommended increasing breast cancer screening intervals for women with an average risk. In this retrospective cohort study using US data from 2004 to 2019, the incidence of in situ breast cancer in women aged ≥ 40 years decreased since 2009, aligning with the reduced use of screening mammography after the guideline changes. However, there was no correlation between the change in recommendations and breast cancer stage at diagnosis or type of surgical treatment. Surgical trends shifted toward breast-conserving surgeries and reconstructive approaches over time. This result may reassure primary care physicians that the shift in recommendations has not resulted in a higher incidence of advanced breast cancer at diagnosis and may have reduced unnecessary interventions and anxiety caused by false-positive results.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 2,022,250 women aged ≥ 40 years with breast cancer (17.5% aged 40–49 years, 63.2% aged 50–74 years, and 19.2% aged ≥ 75 years)

- Study design: population-based, epidemiological, retrospective cohort study

- Setting: Data was collected from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program in the US from 2004 to 2019.

- Outcomes according to age group (40–49 years, 50–74 years, and ≥ 75 years)

- Incidence rates of breast cancer by stage at diagnosis

- Patients treated with partial mastectomy, total mastectomy, and total mastectomy with reconstruction

- Main results

- In situ breast cancer

- Rates increased until 2009 in women aged 40–49 years and until 2008 in women aged ≥ 50 years.

- This was followed by a decline across all age groups; rates stabilized after 2016 in women aged ≥ 75 years.

- Localized breast cancer

- Rates increased steadily from 2004 to 2019 in women aged 40–74 years.

- Rates in women aged ≥ 75 years rose from 2004 to 2011, declined from 2011 to 2017, and sharply increased from 2017 to 2019.

- Regional breast cancer

- Rates decreased until 2016 in women aged 40–49 years, until 2019 in women aged 50–74 years, and from 2008 to 2017 in women aged ≥ 75 years.

- Rates remained largely stable across all age groups thereafter.

- Distant breast cancer: Rates remained stable from 2012 for women aged 40–74 years, while the rates consistently increased for women aged ≥ 75 years between 2004 and 2019.

- Surgical therapy

- Partial mastectomy: Rates increased in women aged ≥ 75 years and after 2012 in women aged 50–74 years.

- Total mastectomy: Rates consistently declined in women aged 40–49 years and ≥ 75 years, and, after 2012, in women aged 50–74 years.

- Total mastectomy with reconstruction: Rates steadily rose in women aged 40–49 years throughout the study period and until 2012 in women aged 50–74 years.

- Limitations include:

- The SEER registries do not capture the entire US population, limiting the generalizability of the findings.

- The risk of confounding by unmeasured factors (e.g., the introduction of digital breast tomosynthesis in 2011, which may have biased results by increasing early-stage cancer detection despite reduced screening) makes it difficult to isolate the true impact of the 2009 guideline changes.

- The study did not account for how breast cancers were detected (i.e., screening vs. symptom-based), which could influence the observed incidence rates and treatment patterns.

- The follow-up period after the guideline change was limited to 10 years, which may not have been sufficient time to capture certain trends.

### Hemochromatosis comorbidities: iron overload may not be the only link

One-Minute Telegram 114-2025-3/3

## 10-second takeaway

Previously, the increased risk of diabetes and other comorbidities (e.g., liver disease) in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis was thought to be linked to iron overload. In this prospective cohort study, individuals homozygous for HFE C282Y had a higher risk of liver diseases and diabetes than non-carriers. Furthermore, the risk of diabetes was also higher in those with normal transferrin saturation and ferritin levels. Individuals homozygous for HFE C282Y with diabetes had a higher risk of death than non-carriers with diabetes. These findings highlight the need for clinicians to remain vigilant for diabetes and its complications in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, even in those with normal iron and ferritin levels and transferrin saturation.

## Study breakdown

- Study population: 132,542 individuals aged 20–100 years, of which 422 individuals (median age, 56 years; 46% male) were homozygous for HFE C282Y

- Study design: prospective cohort study

- Setting: 3 general population cohorts in Denmark

- Exposure

- HFE variants C282Y and H63D

- Plasma iron and ferritin levels and transferrin saturation (measured on the day of enrollment for most participants)

- Main outcomes

- All inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts for diagnoses of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease

- Death

- Main results

- Median follow-up: 41 years

- Compared to non-carriers, C282Y homozygotes:

- Had an increased risk for diabetes diagnosis (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.24–2.39), diabetes with complications (2.03; 1.22–3.38), any liver disease (2.22; 1.40–3.54), and liver cirrhosis (3.42; 1.41–8.27)

- Had a higher risk of diabetes even if transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels were normal

- Did not have a higher risk for heart disease diagnosis

- C282Y homozygotes with diabetes had a higher risk of death from any cause than non-carriers with diabetes (1.94; 1.19–3.18).

- Compared to non-carriers, the risk of diabetes or liver disease was not significantly higher in H63D homozygotes or heterozygotes, C282Y heterozygotes, or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes.

- Limitations include:

- The study was unable to determine whether the increased mortality in C282Y homozygotes with diabetes was caused by diabetes or another unknown associated condition.

- Plasma iron and ferritin levels and transferrin saturation were only measured at study enrollment, meaning that iron overload before the onset of diabetes cannot be ruled out.

- The study was underpowered to analyze the risk of specific causes of death.
