# Tuberculosis

### Summary

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which typically affects the lungs. It is a common infectious cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Primary infection, transmitted via airborne aerosol droplet nuclei, is often initially asymptomatic. M. tuberculosis infection is typically dormant (latent TB infection; LTBI) because of intact innate and cellular immune responses. If the immune system is compromised, however, reactivation of the infection may occur and lead to active TB. Patients with active disease characteristically present with fever, weight loss, night sweats, and a productive cough (with or without hemoptysis) that does not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. The infection may spread hematologically to any organ, causing extrapulmonary TB. However, disseminated disease is rare, occurring in severely immunocompromised individuals. If active TB infection is suspected, imaging should be obtained as well as microscopy, cultures, and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify M. tuberculosis. The treatment of tuberculosis is prolonged due to the slow growth of M. tuberculosis, its concealment in macrophages, and the inability of drugs to easily penetrate its cell wall. Standard treatment includes combination therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for an additional four months. Patients with suspected LTBI should be tested using the purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) and treated accordingly. Treatment of LTBI reduces the risk of active infection in up to 90% of cases and, therefore, plays a crucial role in the prevention of active TB.

- Active tuberculosis

- Definition: any TB infection with symptoms and signs of disease, including primary TB and reactivation of latent TB [1][6][7]

- Features [1]

- Pulmonary TB: the most common form of active TB

- Extrapulmonary TB: The most common forms are TB lymphadenitis and pleural tuberculosis.

- Diagnostics: confirmed if bacilli are present in respiratory secretions or other tissues, and subsequent microbiological testing and imaging results are consistent with active TB [7][8]

- Treatment

- Combination of antibiotics, most commonly given for 6 months  [9]

- Occasionally, invasive procedures (e.g., drainage for pleural TB) or surgery (e.g., lobectomy for drug-resistant TB) may be necessary. [9][10]

- Drug-resistant tuberculosis [11]

- Definition: a form of TB that is resistant to one or more antitubercular agents

- Types

- Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB): resistance to rifampin with or without resistance to other antitubercular drugs

- Monoresistant TB: resistance to one of the first-line antitubercular drugs

- Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin

- Pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (Pre-XDR-TB): resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, and either any fluoroquinolone or a second-line injectable agent (e.g., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) [12]

- Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB): resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, any fluoroquinolone, and either one of the second-line injectable drugs (e.g., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) or bedaquiline or linezolid [12]

- Causes

- Incorrect drug combination therapy

- Inadequate duration or dosage of drug therapy

- Poor treatment adherence

- Poor quality of drugs

- Close contact with an individual with drug-resistant TB

Mycobacterium tuberculosisMycobacterium tuberculosisMycobacterium tuberculosis culture

### Risk factors for tuberculosis exposure [23]

- Working in the health care industry

- Migration from countries with a high TB incidence (≥ 100 cases per 100,000 population) [2]

- Frequent travel to countries with a high TB burden

- Close contact with a patient with active TB infection

- Crowded living conditions (e.g., prisons)

- Homelessness

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Pathophysiology

### Primary tuberculosis [1][3][24]

## Innate immune response

- Exposure to M. tuberculosis

- Individuals with M. tuberculosis infection disperse droplet nuclei that contain bacilli via sneezing or coughing.

- Inhaled droplet nuclei reach the terminal alveoli and are taken up by the alveolar macrophages.

- Entry into macrophages

- Mycobacterial cell wall contains pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipoarabinomannan and lipomannan.

- Alveolar macrophages recognize M. tuberculosis PAMPs via toll-like receptors (TLRs)

- Activation of TLRs leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-12, TNF-α) and phagocytosis of mycobacteria.

- Replication within macrophages

- Typically, phagocytosed organisms reside within a phagosome to undergo intracellular killing via the following steps:

- Phagosome maturation: acidification using a proton pump system  [25]

- Fusion of phagosome and lysosome: mediated by increased intracellular calcium levels [26]

- Killing of bacteria by reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), and lysosomal enzymes

- M. tuberculosis survives within macrophages because of the inhibition of both phagosome maturation and phagolysosome fusion

- Virulence factors involved include: [18]

- Cord factor (trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate): a surface glycolipid that causes serpentine cord-like growth, inhibits neutrophil migration, and induces TNF-α release to stimulate activated macrophages to form granulomas  [27][28]

- Sulfatides: surface glycolipids that inhibit phagolysosome fusion [29]

- Lipoarabinomannan: a lipoglycan that induces TNF-α release from macrophages and scavenges ROS

- Catalase-peroxidase: an enzyme that catalyzes the destruction of ROS and H2O2

- Macrophage lysis and release of bacteria

- Following replication in the alveolar macrophages, the released bacteria attack uninfected macrophages to spread infection.

- Dendritic cells migrate to the site of infection and process mycobacterial antigens.

- Some bacteria enter the bloodstream, causing bacteremia and seeding multiple organs.

## Cellular immune response

- Th1 cell activation

- Dendritic cells present mycobacterial antigens complexed with MHC 2 to naive T cells

- Activated CD4+ T cells migrate to the focus of infection (type IV HSR).

- Macrophage activation and bacterial killing

- Activated CD4+ T cells release IFN-γ

- IFN-γ acts on macrophages to enable bacterial killing via the following mechanisms:

- Promotion of phagosome maturation

- Enhanced RNI production

- Autophagy

- Granulomatous inflammation and tissue destruction

- IFN-γ-activated macrophages secrete TNF-α.

- TNF-α promotes the aggregation of macrophages and T cells to form granulomas, affecting the lungs and regional lymph nodes

- Destruction of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages causes central caseous necrosis and tissue damage.

- Granuloma limits the spread of infection.

- Ghon focus: a granuloma typically located in the middle/lower lung lobes.

- Ghon complex: formed by the Ghon focus, regional lymph node, and the linking lymphatic vessels

- Disease progression

- Sufficient immune response

- Most of the bacteria are killed.

- Some bacteria may persist, causing LTBI.

- The granulomas in the Ghon complex undergo fibrosis and calcification to form the Ranke complex.

- Deficient immune response (e.g., HIV, malnutrition)

- Failure of granulomas to limit infection

- Progressive primary TB causing progressive lung disease, bacteremia, and miliary TB

Tuberculous granuloma with Langhans cellsPulmonary tuberculosisCaseous necrosis in lung tissueRanke complex in tuberculosis

### Secondary tuberculosis [24]

- Latent TB: Dynamic equilibrium is maintained between the host immune response and M. tuberculosis.

- Reactivation of disease: due to weakening of immune response (e.g., resulting from HIV, TNF-α inhibitor therapy)

- Disease progression

- Caseating granulomas with central necrosis and Langhans giant cells are characteristic features.

- Usually affects the upper lobes of the lungs because of higher oxygen tension

- Can also affect other organs (due to seeding of organs in primary tuberculosis)

- Prior sensitization to mycobacterial antigens results in a stronger inflammatory response, causing extensive tissue destruction, cavitation, and scarring.

Stages of pulmonary tuberculosis
CollapseNotesFeedback
### Clinical features

Latent tuberculosis infection does not typically manifest with symptoms. Patients with primary TB are commonly asymptomatic.

### Pulmonary tuberculosis [1]

- Systemic

- Low-grade fever with night sweats

- Weight loss (often severe), anorexia

- Decreased appetite

- Malaise, weakness

- Pulmonary

- Non-productive cough

- Symptoms of progression: productive cough with purulent sputum, hemoptysis

- Shortness of breath

- Pleuritic chest pain  [30]

- Clinical examination: Findings are nonspecific.

- General: pallor, clubbing (advanced disease), generalized wasting

- Chest examination: Findings vary depending on the type and degree of pulmonary involvement.

- Consolidation: dullness on percussion, crackles, diminished breath sounds

- Cavitation: hyperresonance on percussion, amphoric breath sounds

- Bronchial obstruction: rhonchi

- Pleural effusion and/or empyema: dullness on percussion, diminished breath sounds

- Other possible findings: erythema nodosum, phlyctenular conjunctivitis

Depending on the degree of immunosuppression, TB in HIV-positive individuals may progress atypically or more rapidly.
Always consider TB as a differential diagnosis in a young individual with hemoptysis and if treatment for other pulmonary conditions (e.g., pneumonia) does not improve symptoms.

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis

See “Extrapulmonary tuberculosis” for respective clinical features.
CollapseNotesFeedback
### Diagnosis

This section reviews the diagnosis of active tuberculosis infection. For screening and diagnosis of latent TB, see the section “Latent tuberculosis.”

### Approach [7]

- Initial workup in all patients

- Focused patient history (e.g., exposure to individuals with TB, history of visiting or living in countries with a high TB burden)

- Microbiological studies

- Initial tests: microscopy examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)

- Confirmatory test: mycobacterial culture (gold standard)

- Drug susceptibility testing: indicated in certain circumstances to identify resistant mycobacteria

- Consider CT chest or CXR

- Suspicion for extrapulmonary TB: Additional invasive procedures (e.g., lymph node biopsy, thoracocentesis) may be required for bacteriological confirmation (see “Extrapulmonary TB”). [31]

Lung cancer is an important differential diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Start investigations for malignancy in any patient with systemic symptoms (e.g., weight loss, persistent fevers, anorexia) and abnormal imaging.
PPD TST and IGRA are screening tests for latent TB and do not aid in the diagnostics of active TB. [7]

### Laboratory studies [1]

Laboratory findings are mostly unspecific but can provide important information during initial diagnostic stages. Possible findings include:

- CBC: mild leukocytosis (common) , anemia (in advanced disease)

- BMP: mild hyponatremia

- Liver chemistries: ↑ in concomitant liver disease; useful as a baseline prior to treatment [32]

- Other nonspecific findings: ↑ ESR, pyuria in renal disease [32]

### Microbiological studies [7]

Confirmation of the presence of tuberculosis bacilli in different samples is done by direct visualization, positive culture, or by detecting genetic material. Samples used for testing include: [7]

- Sputum samples (most common): Obtain ≥ 3 samples separated by 8 to 24-hour intervals (should include at least one early morning sample).  [7][33][34]

- Induced sputum   [34]

- Gastric lavage  [35]

- Bronchoalveolar lavage

- Extrapulmonary TB suspected: Fluid specimens or tissue samples should be sent for cell count, chemistries, AFB smear microscopy, and NAAT.  [7]

Because sputum induction carries a high risk of transmission to health care workers, the procedure must be performed under strict infection control precautions. [36]

| Microbiological tests for active TB [7][37] |
| --- |
| Test | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| Acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy | Ziehl Neelsen stain or auramine rhodamine stain are used. | Rapid detection Inexpensive | Low sensitivity  [37] Cannot differentiate M. tuberculosis from other nontuberculous mycobacteria  [38] Both viable and nonviable mycobacteria will stain.  [39] |
| Nucleic acid amplification test | For initial testing (along with AFB smear microscopy and culture) if clinical suspicion is high Used for confirmation of AFB positive smears [7] | High specificity and sensitivity (lower sensitivity in individuals with a negative AFB smear)  [37] Rapid diagnosis  Rapid detection of drug-resistant strains  [37] Low cross-reactivity with nontuberculous mycobacteria [37] | Requires laboratory equipment and trained staff, which may make use in resource-limited settings more difficult Both viable and nonviable mycobacteria are detectable. [36] |
| Culture | Gold standard diagnostic test Provides information on drug susceptibility | High sensitivity  [37] Species identification Identification of drug resistance | Takes 2 to 6 weeks for positive cultures to develop  [37] Delays the initiation of treatment, especially drug-resistant TB |

Request AFB and cultures of every sample obtained; request NAAT for the initial respiratory sample along with microscopy and culture if clinical suspicion is high. [7]

## Drug susceptibility testing [7]

- Standard culture: used to assess for drug susceptibility in most patients; results are available after several weeks.

- Rapid molecular testing : for select patients at high risk of resistant tuberculosis [7]

- History of previously treated tuberculosis

- Contact with individuals with MDR-TB

- HIV infection

- Patients born or having lived for ≥ 1 year in a country with moderate to high TB incidence or high MDR-TB prevalence  [7]

A negative AFB smear microscopy result does not rule out pulmonary TB and a confirmatory culture should be obtained. [7]

### Imaging [7][8][40]

- Indications: often performed as part of the diagnostic workup of patients with respiratory symptoms

- Modalities: x-ray or CT chest

- Findings

- Highly variable and nonspecific, but can help narrow the differential diagnosis

- In primary TB, chest x-ray is often normal.

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Chest imaging findings in active TB [32][40] |
| --- |
|  | Primary TB (middle/lower lobes) | Postprimary (reactivation) TB |
| Chest x-ray | Consolidation (homogeneous with ill-defined borders)  Hilar lymphadenopathy (commonly unilateral)  Ghon complex  Pleural effusion   Cavitation (rare) | Consolidation (patchy or confluent) Fibrocaseous cavitary lesions in upper lobes  Calcifications |
| CT chest | Enlarged lymph nodes with low-attenuation center indicating central necrosis [8] | Thick-walled cavities without an air-fluid level Tree-in-bud pattern |

Extensive cavitation can lead to areas of bronchiectasis and damaged lung areas can be colonized with Aspergillus spp., leading to aspergillomas, sometimes referred to as fungus balls. [32]
Normal imaging does not rule out TB. Although radiographic changes are common in immunocompetent patients, individuals who are immunocompromised can have normal imaging findings. [8][31][40]

### HIV and TB coinfection

Diagnosing TB in patients with HIV coinfection is challenging because these individuals often have a negative AFB smear and commonly have atypical imaging findings resulting from paucibacillary disease due to a reduced immune response. Different measures can be used to increase diagnostic sensitivity. [31][36]

- Advanced testing in patients with HIV (not widely available) [36]

- For most patients: fluorescent AFB smear microscopy , specialized culture mediums

- For patients with severe disease and those with a CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3: lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay [41][42][43]

- In resource-limited settings: a lower threshold for defining smear positivity and consideration of empiric treatment may be necessary  [36]

In patients with HIV, the sensitivity of routine initial microbiological studies may be low; additional investigations may be required.
Obtain HIV tests in all patients with suspected (rather than confirmed) TB, as this can help to interpret test results. [36]

### Treatment

This section reviews the treatment of active tuberculosis. For the treatment of latent TB, see the section “Latent tuberculosis.”

### General principles [1][9]

- Goals

- Reduction of disease severity and risk of transmission

- Eradication of all bacilli to achieve sustained cure without relapse following completion of treatment

- Prevention of drug resistance during therapy

- Infection control measures

- Case notification: mandatory reporting to local health department  [44]

- Airborne precautions: should include a surgical mask for the patient and adequate personal protective equipment (including respirators) for medical staff and caregivers  [45]

- Contact tracing: See “Prevention” section for testing indications.

- Antituberculosis therapy

- All patients should undergo a pretreatment evaluation.

- Choice of pharmacologic therapy is based on the site of infection and drug susceptibility.

### Indications for treatment [9]

- Confirmed active TB

- Positive culture for M. tuberculosis

- Positive NAAT (with positive or negative AFB smear microscopy)

- Suspected active TB: Consider empiric treatment in all patients pending test results.

- Factors favoring empiric treatment: high risk of disease progression and/or dissemination , imaging consistent with active TB, positive screening , critically ill patients, high transmission risk

- Factors favoring delayed therapy: no known TB exposure, high risk of therapy side effects, negative NAAT (with positive or negative AFB smear microscopy)

Empiric treatment with standard antituberculosis therapy is indicated in most cases in which active infection is suspected. [9]

### Pretreatment evaluation [9]

- Clinical assessment

- Weight

- Nutritional assessment

- Symptom review

- Eye exam: visual acuity and color discrimination

- Microbiology: sputum smear microscopy and culture, drug susceptibility testing

- Imaging: chest x-ray or other chest imaging

- Laboratory studies

- All patients: liver chemistries; , platelet count, BMP, HIV screening

- Depending on risk: hepatitis B and hepatitis C screening, diabetes screen, β-HCG in individuals who can become pregnant

### Antituberculosis therapy

Consultation with infectious disease experts is advised.

## RIPE TB regimen [9][46]

- Intensive phase: : 8 weeks (∼ 2 months) of rifampin  DOSAGE  PLUS isoniazid DOSAGE , pyrazinamide DOSAGE  , and ethambutol DOSAGE   [9]

- Continuation phase: : 18 weeks (∼ 4 months) of rifampin  DOSAGE  PLUS isoniazid DOSAGE   [9]

- Adjuvant treatment: : pyridoxine  DOSAGE  to prevent vitamin B6 deficiency resulting from isoniazid (promotes pyridoxine excretion) for all individuals at risk of neuropathy  [9]

- Additional considerations

- Self-administered and daily dosages are preferred

- Directly observed therapy (DOT; standard practice): Health care personnel observe the patient taking the medication.

- Restart full treatment if there is an interruption of ≥ 14 days during the intensive phase.

RIPE TB regimen consists of 6 months of rifampin and isoniazid plus pyrazinamide and ethambutol during the first 2 months.
"RIPE": Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol
The long duration of treatment for active TB requires patient-centered coordination with primary care and specialist services and directly observed therapy (DOT) to ensure adherence. [47]

## 4-month regimen for TB [46][48][49]

This regimen may be considered for patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB who are age ≥ 12 years, ≥ 40 kg, and without contraindications (e.g., drug-drug interactions, prolonged QT syndrome, pregnancy).

- Intensive phase: 8 weeks of rifapentine DOSAGE , isoniazid DOSAGE , pyrazinamide DOSAGE , and moxifloxacin DOSAGE

- Continuation phase: 9 weeks of rifapentine DOSAGE , isoniazid DOSAGE , and moxifloxacin DOSAGE

- Adjuvant treatment: Pyridoxine DOSAGE  to prevent vitamin B6 deficiency resulting from isoniazid

- Additional considerations: DOT should be implemented during the treatment period.

## Treatment of drug-resistant TB disease [10][49]

This includes MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Consultation with infectious disease experts is required.

- Agents

- Oral: later-generation fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin), bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine, cycloserine, pretomanid [50]

- IV: amikacin, streptomycin, and carbapenem with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid

- Phases of treatment: combine at least 3–5 agents for the intensive and continuation phases

- Role of surgery: Elective partial lung surgery can be beneficial.

An all-oral regimen (i.e., bedaquilline, pretomanid, and linezolid ± moxifloxacin) may be considered for drug-resistant TB based on drug susceptibility. [49]

## Treatment of extrapulmonary TB [9]

Choose antimicrobials under specialist guidance and tailor choice and duration of therapy to the infection site, severity, and response.

- Standard antituberculosis therapy (e.g., 6-month RIPE TB regimen): used for lymph node, pleural, miliary, pericardial, adrenal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary TB

- Extended regimens

- TB meningoencephalitis (9–12 months of therapy)

- 2 months of 4-drug intensive phase, followed by 7–10 months of continuation phase with isoniazid and rifampin

- See RIPE TB regimen for daily dosages.

- Adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment with dexamethasone or prednisolone for 6–8 weeks

- Pott disease and other bone and joint TB

- Typically 6–9 months of therapy

- May be extended up to 12 months

- Surgery in select patients

Consultation with a specialist is always advised in all patients with extrapulmonary TB, especially for miliary disease.

### Side effects of antituberculosis agents [9]

Mild side effects can usually be managed with symptomatic treatment, while more severe side effects (e.g., significant hepatotoxicity, optic neuritis) usually require one or more drugs to be discontinued and replaced in consultation with a specialist.

- General side effects: may be caused by any of the drugs commonly used in standard antituberculosis therapy

- Hepatotoxicity (most common serious side effect)

- Rash, pruritus

- GI symptoms

- Allergic and nonallergic hypersensitivity reactions

| Rifampin | Transient asymptomatic elevation of bilirubin, clinical hepatitis with a cholestatic injury pattern Cytochrome P450 induction: leading to important interactions with ART in patients with HIV (therefore, rifabutin is preferred)  Orange discoloration of body fluids (e.g., urine, tears)  Thrombocytopenia False-positive result on urine opiate screening |
| Pyrazinamide | Greatest hepatotoxicity potential Hyperuricemia  [9] Arthralgia Photosensitivity |
| Ethambutol | Optic neuritis (reversible red-green color blindness) Hyperuricemia [56] |

Rifampin and isoniazid alter the efficacy of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (especially protease inhibitors, NNRTIs, OCPs, warfarin, sulfonylureas).
Orange urine secondary to rifampicin therapy

### Monitoring [9][44]

Monthly follow-ups are recommended in all patients receiving antituberculosis treatment for active TB or LTBI.

- All patients

- Assess adherence to therapy.

- Perform a symptom review and screen for clinical features of active TB.

- Monitor for side effects.

- Patients with active TB

- Sputum smear microscopy and culture

- Weight and vision assessment

- Laboratory studies: If indicated, obtain liver chemistries, platelet count, and creatinine.

Advise patients to self-monitor for features that suggest hepatitis (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain) and seek prompt medical attention if any of them arise. [44]
CollapseNotesFeedback
### Latent tuberculosis infection

### Description

- A state of constant immune response stimulation due to M. tuberculosis antigens, with no signs of active TB infection

- Individuals with latent TB are asymptomatic and not contagious.

M. tuberculosis remains dormant within the host and may be reactivated once the immune system becomes compromised (e.g., by high doses of glucocorticoids or chemotherapeutic agents, HIV infection).

### Epidemiology [14]

- The prevalence of LTBI in the United States is estimated to be 5%.

- 5–10% of untreated cases progress to active TB if left untreated.

### Diagnosis [7][44]

## Screening for LTBI [7][57][58]

The decision of whether to test an individual should be carefully considered based on the likelihood of someone having LTBI, the likelihood of progression of LTBI to active TB, and the potential benefit of therapy.

- Individuals with a high likelihood of LTBI (i.e., high risk of TB exposure; see also “Risk factors for tuberculosis”) [7][44]

- Known contact with AFB smear-positive individual

- Individuals born in or former residents of countries with a high TB burden (> 20 cases per 100,000 population)  [58]

- People who live or work in high-risk settings (e.g., correctional facilities, long-term care facilities or nursing homes, homeless shelters)

- Health-care workers who care for patients at increased risk for TB disease

- Children (< 18 years of age) exposed to adults at increased risk for tuberculosis infection

- Individuals with a high likelihood of progression from LTBI to active TB [7][44]

- High risk factors:

- HIV infection

- Immunosuppressive therapy, including: [59]

- Corticosteroid therapy  [60][61]

- TNF-α inhibitor therapy (e.g., infliximab)  [62]

- Others: methotrexate, cyclosporine; drugs used for organ transplant and stem cell transplant recipients

- Silicosis

- Age < 5 years

- Prior TB infection

- Intermediate risk factors: diabetes, chronic kidney disease, IV drug use

- Other risk factors:

- Smoking  [63]

- Heavy alcohol consumption  [64]

- Malnutrition, low body mass index

- Advanced age  [65]

- Malignancy

- Gastrectomy or jejunoileal bypass

All patients with HIV should be screened for LTBI, regardless of additional risk factors. [44]
All individuals due to start immunosuppressive therapy should be screened for LTBI. [59]

## Selection of screening test [7]

- Most patients: IGRA (preferred in those who have had the BCG vaccine) or PPD TST  [44]

- Patients with HIV, children aged < 5 years, immunocompromised patients

- PPD TST and chest x-ray

- OR IGRA and chest x-ray

| Limitations | Does not differentiate between active and latent TB Variability in test interpretation [67] Requires two office visits False positives resulting from either of the following: Prior BCG vaccination  [69] Exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria False negatives are possible in patients with any of the following: Sarcoidosis [70] Immunosuppressed state (anergy) Age < 6 months Recent (within 8–10 weeks) or very old (many years) TB infection Recent live-virus vaccination  Disseminated TB disease | No differentiation between active and latent TB Expensive [44] Errors in collecting and transporting blood can decrease accuracy.  [14] |

Positive Mantoux testTuberculin skin test (Mendel-Mantoux test)

## Interpretation of results [7][44]

- IGRA

- Positive: TB infection is likely

- Negative: TB infection is unlikely, but cannot be excluded

- Indeterminate: can occur in inflammation or infection;   and/or immunosuppressed states (e.g., due to immunomodulatory medications and/or HIV infection), and a repeat IGRA or PPD TST can be useful [71]

- PPD TST: Depending on patient characteristics, a PPD TST can be positive with an induration ≥ 5 mm, ≥ 10 mm, or ≥ 15 mm.

- For healthy individuals with no risk factors, an induration < 15 mm is considered negative for TB.

- For patients with BCG vaccination history, interpret a positive PPD TST according to induration diameter and relevant risk factors.  [69]

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Positive PPD TST according to induration diameter [44] |
| --- |
| ≥ 5 mm | Individuals exposed to AFB smear-positive case Individuals with HIV Individuals with clinical or radiographic evidence of active or prior TB Individuals with organ transplants or receiving immunosuppressive therapy |
| ≥ 10 mm | Individuals who have moved within the last 5 years from a country with a high TB burden (> 20 cases per 100,000 population) [7] Individuals living or working in high-risk settings (e.g., homeless shelters, prisons) Individuals who inject drugs Mycobacteriology laboratory workers Individuals with illnesses such as diabetes and CKD Children < 5 years of age Children who have had contact with adults in high-risk categories Individuals with low BMI |
| ≥ 15 mm | All otherwise healthy individuals with no known risk factors [72] |

The diagnosis of LTBI is based on a positive screening result in patients with a medical history and physical examination consistent with latent disease, once active TB has been excluded. [14]
If screening for LTBI is positive, it is still necessary to exclude active TB prior to starting treatment for LTBI because neither screening test can differentiate between active and latent infection. [14]

## Further evaluation

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Management of individuals screened for TB [73] |
| --- |
|  | Initial management | Further management |
| Positive IGRA or TST | Chest x-ray to exclude active TB Individuals with low risk: Diagnosis can be confirmed with dual testing using the same or a different testing method. [74] | Chest x-ray is normal: Treat for LTBI. Chest x-ray is abnormal: Work up for active TB. |
| IGRA or TST negative | If < 8–10 weeks since exposure | Immunocompetent individuals and children ≥ 5 years of age: no treatment; repeat screening test 8–10 weeks following exposure. Immunocompromised individuals and children < 5 years of age: Start treatment for LTBI until TST or IGRA is repeated 8–10 weeks following exposure. | Repeat screening test is positive: chest x-ray Chest x-ray is normal: Treat for LTBI. Chest x-ray is abnormal: Work up for active TB. Repeat screening test is negative No treatment is required; stop treatment if already initiated. HIV patients: Consider completing LTBI treatment if exposed to an individual with active TB. |
| If > 8–10 weeks since exposure | No further evaluation is required. |

If health care workers are exposed to an individual with active TB without adequate personal protective equipment, IGRA or PPD TST must be performed immediately and repeated after 8–10 weeks if the initial test is negative. [75]

## Special situations [44]

- HIV infection: Screen for LTBI at the time of diagnosis and repeat annually in patients at risk of exposure.

- BCG vaccination: IGRA is preferred to PPD TST.  [69]

- Screening prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy: Follow the usual screening algorithm, but consider a second test if the initial screening test is negative.  [76]

- Individuals who are periodically tested with PPD TST

- TST results may be affected by booster phenomenon

- Consider two-step TST in select cases to avoid misinterpretation; two-step testing is not required if IGRA is used as a baseline test.

- Method: initial baseline TST and a second TST 1–3 weeks later

- Interpretation: Repeat TST is considered positive if TST conversion occurs.  [77]

- Negative repeat TST: LTBI is unlikely and no further management is required.

- Positive repeat TST: A boosted reaction has occurred and LTBI is likely and requires further management.

### Treatment

The primary goal of the treatment of latent TB is to prevent reactivation to active TB.

## Pretreatment considerations [44]

- Medical and drug history

- Baseline liver chemistries (for all individuals at risk of liver injury)

- Exclusion of active TB: Patients should have no clinical or radiological evidence of TB.

- Most patients: Obtain AFB smear microscopy ONLY if symptoms or radiological features are identified.

- Patients with HIV: Consider AFB smear microscopy regardless of symptoms or radiological features.

- Case notification: Reporting to the local health department is advised and may be mandatory in some locations.

- Infection control: Airborne precautions are not required once active pulmonary TB has been excluded. [78]

- Patient education: Provide information about treatment and its side effects, methods available to support adherence to therapy, and instructions to seek medical attention if side effects occur.

## Pharmacotherapy of LTBI [44]

- Pharmacological therapy: indicated for patients with positive IGRA or PPD TST after active TB has been excluded

- Rifamycin-based short regimens are preferred.

- Long regimens may be considered based on drug tolerance, pharmacological interactions, and HIV status.

Caseous necrosis in lung tissuePutty kidney in urogenital tuberculosisRanke complex in tuberculosis

### Histopathology [3]

Caseating tuberculous granulomas are a characteristic finding of tuberculosis, most commonly reactivation (secondary) tuberculosis.

- Center: area of necrosis

- Periphery: epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans giant cells

Caseating granulomas are strongly associated with tuberculosis but can also occur in infections such as histoplasmosis or those caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria like Mycobacterium avium.

### Prevention

### Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) [102]

- Composition: live attenuated strain of M. bovis

- Administration: 0.05–0.3 mL of reconstituted vaccine using multiple puncture device over the deltoid region  [103]

- Indications

- Countries with a high TB burden: all newborns at birth [104]

- Countries with a low TB burden  [104]

- Children with a negative PPD TST and who have come into contact with adults with untreated/inadequately treated TB or drug-resistant TB (if the child cannot take long-term medication for infection)

- Health care workers continually exposed to individuals with drug-resistant TB

- Other uses: intravesical chemotherapy in superficial bladder cancer

- Benefits: protects against tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB in children [105]

- Adverse effects

- Localized lymphadenitis and abscess

- Disseminated TB disease

- Contraindications

- Immunocompromised individuals

- Pregnancy

The BCG vaccine is not widely used in the US and is only given to very select people in consultation with a TB expert. [106]

### Disinfectants active against M. tuberculosis [107]

- Hydrogen peroxide

- Phenol

- Iodophor

- Chlorine-based solutions

- Glutaraldehyde

### Contact tracing and postexposure management [73]

Contact tracing is standard practice in resource-rich countries. Contact tracing and treatment are usually prioritized in cases involving patients with highly infectious TB, vulnerable contacts, or high-risk exposures. [73][108]

- Exposure risk assessment

- Factors that increase contagiousness of the index case

- Pulmonary or laryngeal TB

- Positive sputum smear microscopy

- Cavitary lesions on chest x-ray

- Untreated or inadequately treated TB

- Factors that increase contacts' vulnerability to infection

- Age < 5 years

- Immune status: HIV infection, corticosteroid use

- Comorbid conditions

- Type of exposure: intensity, frequency, duration of exposure

- Management of contacts

- Symptomatic contacts: Obtain sputum smear microscopy and chest x-ray and manage according to results.

- Asymptomatic contacts: Screening tests are indicated, see “Latent tuberculosis” for recommendations on test selection and next steps.

Offer HIV testing to all contacts if HIV status is unknown. [73]
Contact tracing is recommended if the index case has pulmonary or laryngeal TB or has a positive AFB smear. [73]

## Postexposure management in health care settings [75]

- All US health care workers are screened for LTBI at the beginning of their employment.

- Health care workers with previous documented LTBI or active TB do not need a screening test after exposure and should be evaluated if features of active TB develop.

### Special patient groups

### Management of TB in pregnant individuals [9][44][109]

## General [44][109]

- The diagnostic workup is the same as for nonpregnant individuals.

- Indications for TB testing include:

- Symptoms of TB

- Risk factors for TB

- A high likelihood of progression from LTBI to active TB (see “Screening for LTBI”)

- Abdominal shielding should be used to protect the fetus when performing chest x-rays.

- Liver transaminases should be monitored in patients receiving isoniazid due to an increased risk of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

## Latent TB [44][109]

- Active TB must to be ruled out by symptom review and chest x-ray before initiating treatment for LTBI.

- Treatment can be delayed until 2–3 months postpartum for women who are not at increased risk of developing active TB.

- Treatment should not be delayed in patients at high risk of developing active TB.

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Drug regimens for treatment of LTBI in pregnant women [44] |
| --- |
|  | Detailed regimen |
| Short regimens | Isoniazid and rifampin once daily for 3 months (abbreviation: 3HR) PLUS pyridoxine |
| Rifampin once daily for 4 months (abbreviation: 4R) |
| Long regimens | Isoniazid once daily for 6 months (abbreviation: 6H) or 9 months (abbreviation: 9H) PLUS pyridoxine |

The 3HP regimen (once-weekly isoniazid and once-weekly rifapentine) is not recommended for pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant during the treatment period due to lack of data on safety during pregnancy. [44]

## Active TB [9][109]

- Standard first-line regimen

- Intensive phase: daily rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol for 2 months

- Continuation phase: daily rifampin and isoniazid for 7 months

- Adjuvant treatment: pyridoxine to prevent vitamin B6 deficiency

- Extrapulmonary or drug-resistant TB: Seek specialist advice. [10]

- Special considerations on pyrazinamide

- While the WHO recommends pyrazinamide as part of the standard treatment regimen for pregnant women, the CDC and FDA does not recommend its routine use in pregnant women due to a lack of studies in animals as well as humans. [9][109]

- If pyrazinamide is not used, pregnant patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB should be treated for at least 9 months.

Standard first-line therapy for pregnant patients consists of 9 months with isoniazid and rifampin plus ethambutol during the first 2 months.
Streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy.

### Management during the postpartum period [9][109][110]

- Isolation: Mothers do not need to isolate themselves from their babies after birth but should wear a surgical mask.

- Breastfeeding recommendations

- Breastfeeding should be encouraged in women receiving treatment with standard first-line agents.

- Mothers should be informed that rifampin can cause harmless orange discoloration of breastmilk.

- Exclusively breastfed infants should also receive prophylactic pyridoxine if the mother is taking isoniazid.

### Complications of TB during pregnancy [110]

- Maternal

- Preeclampsia

- Eclampsia

- Antepartum hemorrhage

- Miscarriage

- Fetal

- Intrauterine growth restriction

- Preterm birth

- Low birth weight

- Increased risk of vertical HIV transmission [111]

- Congenital TB (rare)  [110]

- Perinatal death
