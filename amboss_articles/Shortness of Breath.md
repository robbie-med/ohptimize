### Summary

Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, is a subjective feeling of breathing discomfort. It is a commonly reported symptom in acute care and outpatient settings. Causes of dyspnea include pulmonary (e.g., pneumonia, asthma exacerbation), cardiac (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure), toxic-metabolic (e.g., metabolic acidosis, medication use), upper airway (e.g., epiglottitis, foreign body aspiration), psychological, and neuromuscular pathologies. On initial presentation, it is important to immediately evaluate the patient for any urgent or life-threatening causes of dyspnea using patient history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. Once immediately life-threatening causes have been ruled out, a more detailed patient history should be obtained and further testing performed to narrow the differential diagnosis.

### Initial management

### Approach [1][2][3]

Assume that all dyspnea is life-threatening until proven otherwise and perform the following steps concurrently, not sequentially.

- Perform an ABCDE survey and place the patient in a position of comfort.

- Manage respiratory failure if present, e.g., airway management, oxygen therapy if SpO2 < 95%, respiratory support [2].

- Begin pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring; establish IV access.

- Initiate treatment for life-threatening reversible causes of dyspnea.

- Identify and treat the underlying cause.

- Focused history and examination

- Basic diagnostics: initial laboratory studies , CXR, ECG, POCUS

- Advanced diagnostic testing based on initial findings

Prioritize rapid identification and treatment of critical causes of dyspnea over advanced testing to obtain a definitive diagnosis. [4]
When evaluating a patient with dyspnea, always consider infection control and the need for PPE and patient isolation.

### Red flags in dyspnea

The presence of any of these red flags suggests that dyspnea is the result of a serious pathologic process.

- Symptoms

- Dyspnea at rest

- Chest pain

- Diaphoresis

- Signs

- Pulmonary: low SpO2, cyanosis, stridor, signs of increased work of breathing

- Cardiac: hypotension, distant heart sounds, new murmur, pulsus paradoxus

- Neurological: decreased level of consciousness, agitation, focal neurological deficits

- Laboratory findings

- Hypoxemia

- Respiratory acidosis

Anticipate rapid clinical deterioration in patients with red flag features.

### Immediately life-threatening causes of dyspnea

See also “Rapidly reversible causes of respiratory failure.”

- Upper airway

- Angioedema

- Anaphylaxis

- Deep neck space infections

- Foreign body aspiration

- Pulmonary

- Pulmonary embolism

- Asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation

- Tension pneumothorax

- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

- ARDS

- Cardiac

- Acute coronary syndrome

- Acute heart failure or flash pulmonary edema

- Cardiac arrhythmias

- Acute valvular dysfunction

- Cardiac tamponade

- Other

- Stroke

- Diabetic ketoacidosis

The severity of symptoms reported by the patient may not correlate with disease severity. Remain vigilant for life-threatening causes of dyspnea. [2]

### Diagnostics

The diagnostic evaluation of undifferentiated dyspnea aims to first rule out immediately life-threatening causes of dyspnea and then determine the etiology, guided by the pretest probability of the diagnoses under consideration.

### Initial evaluation [2][5][6]

Applicable to most patients with undifferentiated dyspnea

- Laboratory studies

- ABG

- Troponin

- CBC

- BMP

- D-dimer

- BNP or pro-BNP

- Influenza and COVID-19 testing

- Imaging

- CXR

- POCUS [6]

- Focused cardiac ultrasound

- Lung POCUS

- DVT POCUS

- Other: ECG

### Additional evaluation

Guided by clinical assessment and pretest probability

- Laboratory studies

- Respiratory viral panel

- Sputum and blood cultures

- Serum salicylate level

- Thyroid function tests

- Lumbar puncture

- Imaging

- Echocardiogram   [7]

- CTPA or V/Q scan   [8][9]

- CT brain without IV contrast

- CT neck with IV contrast

- Other: peak expiratory flow
