# Substance-related and addictive disorders

### Summary
Substance-related and addictive disorders are a category of conditions in the DSM-5 that include substance-use disorders (SUDs), substance-induced disorders, and gambling disorder (a non-substance-related addictive disorder). These disorders are characterized by often increasingly risky use of addictive substances and/or engagement in harmful behaviors despite significant distress and/or adverse consequences. Substance use can lead to physical and psychological dependence, including substance tolerance and withdrawal with dose reduction or cessation. Substance-related and addictive disorders are associated with criminal behavior, social isolation, housing instability, declining academic or professional performance, and new or worsening psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., major depressive disorder, psychosis, anxiety disorder). Treatment typically involves counseling (e.g., motivational interviewing), psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), and/or pharmacotherapy.CollapseNotesFeedback

### Definitions

### Substance use disorder [2][3][4]

- Description: a chronic condition in which an uncontrolled pattern of substance use leads to significant physical, psychological, and social impairment or distress, with continued use despite substance-related problems.

- Epidemiology

- Sex: ♂ > ♀

- Alcohol and nicotine use are most common.

- Characteristics: features that are typical for all substance use disorders (≥ 2 features must occur within 1 year to fulfill the DSM-V criteria)

- Impaired control

- Using a substance in larger amounts and/or for a longer time than originally intended

- Repeated failed attempts to cut down on use

- A great deal of time spent on substance-related activities (e.g., seeking out, buying, using, recovering from use)

- Intense desire to obtain and use substance (craving)

- Social impairment

- Problems fulfilling work, school, family, or social obligations (e.g., not attending work or school, neglecting children or partner)

- Problems with interpersonal relationships directly related to substance use (withdrawal from relationships, marital issues)

- Reduced social, occupational, and recreational activities (e.g., less time socializing with friends, neglecting hobbies)

- Risky use

- Use in physically hazardous situations;  (e.g., driving a car under the influence, unprotected sex, operating heavy machinery)

- Continued use despite awareness of problems related to or exacerbated by substance use (e.g., continued alcohol use despite having cirrhosis)

- Pharmacologic indicators

- Drug tolerance: the need to continuously increase the dose of a substance to achieve the same desired effect

- Drug withdrawal: a substance-dependent collection of symptoms that appear after cessation of prolonged heavy drug use accompanied by a strong urge to readminister the substance

- Often, withdrawal symptoms are the opposite of intoxication effects, e.g., heroin intoxication causes sedation and constipation, whereas heroin withdrawal causes anxiety, insomnia, and diarrhea.

- Hallucinogens and inhalants do not cause withdrawal.

- Exception: patients undergoing supervised treatment with certain psychoactive substances (e.g., stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic drugs, anxiolytic drugs, cannabis) [5]

- Tolerance and withdrawal can be normal physiological adaptations.

- In the absence of other DSM-V criteria, tolerance and withdrawal do not necessarily indicate substance use disorder.

Withdrawal from some substances, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, can be fatal!

### Substance-induced disorders

- Intoxication: a temporary condition caused by recent ingestion of a substance that alters a person's consciousness, cognition, perception, judgment, affect, and/or behavior; commonly occurs in substance use disorders but also in one-off use

- Withdrawal: a condition characterized by behavioral, physiological, and cognitive changes caused by a sudden reduction or cessation of substance intake after a prolonged period of heavy intake; usually occurs in association with substance use disorders

- Substance/medication-induced mental disorders: a psychiatric disorder that develops within 1 month of intoxication or withdrawal of a substance and is not attributable to an independent mental disorder (e.g., substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder)

### Related definitions

- Abuse

- In the context of substance use, the term “abuse” should generally be avoided due to its impreciseness  and the historical burden of stigma.

- “Substance use” is generally the preferred term in this context, with “substance misuse” being appropriate in the context of prescription drugs.

- Drug-seeking behavior

- A maladaptive behavioral response to substance addiction that involves manipulative and/or demanding behaviors to obtain the desired substance

- Often indicative of an underlying substance use disorder

- Examples of drug-seeking behavior

- Faking/aggravating symptoms

- Bribes, threats, theft (e.g., prescription pads)

- Forging prescriptions or using those of others (e.g., under the names of family members)

- Pretending to lose prescriptions and asking for new ones

- Insisting that a treatment that does not involve one or more certain (addictive) drugs is ineffective or not tolerated (e.g., due to an alleged allergy)

- Demanding a stronger medication or higher dose due to an allegedly high drug tolerance

- Claiming that another, an ostensibly more experienced or more caring, physician would prescribe the desired drug or threatening to see another physician if the desired drug is not prescribed.

- Medication-assisted treatment (MAT): treatment for substance use disorder that combines counseling with pharmacological and behavioral therapy, tailored to each patient's needs.  [6]

### Pathophysiology

### Neurobiological concepts of addiction development

## Mesolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway (endogenous reward system)

- Anatomical components

- The core pathway involves the transport of dopamine (the primary neurotransmitter of reward) from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the forebrain.

- Modulating areas

- This system interacts with the prefrontal cortex (decision-making), the amygdala (emotion/fear), the hippocampus (memory), and the thalamus.

- Neurotransmitters involved: e.g., glutamate, GABA, opioids, and norepinephrine

- Significance: The interplay of these modulators determines whether a drug has a sedative (e.g., increased GABA) or excitatory (e.g., increased glutamate/dopamine) effect

- Physiological function (normal state): motivation center that reinforces behaviors necessary for survival (eating, reproduction)

- Stimulus perception (e.g., seeing food) → dopamine release from the VTA to the NAc → motivation or desire to perform an action (e.g., eating) → performing the behavior → the NAc signals satisfaction (e.g., satiety)

- Repeated performance of the behavior → long-term potentiation (cellular adaptation processes and association of stimulus and response) → the behavior becomes a learned habit that requires less conscious cortical effort over time

- Pathological function (addiction): drug stimuli override natural survival needs

- Hyper-stimulation: drugs cause a dopamine release significantly higher/longer than natural rewards (like food or sex) → strong desire (craving)

- Perceptual narrowing: Because the dopamine signal for the drug is so strong, natural rewards (sleep, social interaction) can no longer compete. The brain prioritizes drug-seeking behavior above all else.

- Chronification (habit formation): The stimulus-response chain becomes automatic. Even if the pleasure decreases due to tolerance, the "habit" (wanting) remains strong because the neural pathway is physically reinforced.

Even after long periods of abstinence, patients with addiction have an increased sensitivity to addiction-related stimuli because the behavioral patterns are neuronally consolidated.
By increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), addictive drugs activate the brain's primary reward center. This dopamine spike serves as positive reinforcement, strengthening the drug-reward association and driving the compulsion for repeated use.

## Neural correlates in addiction

- Neural correlates of impaired impulse control: imbalance between the regulatory and emotional systems

- Weakening of brain areas that are important for the voluntary control of behavior → loss of control

- Weakening of the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic reward system

- Direct neurotoxic drug effect on areas necessary for impulse control

- Strengthening of brain areas that promote impulsive behavior

- Neural correlates of tolerance development: changes in neurotransmission

- E.g., reduction of the central nervous effect of a substance of abuse by changing the number of involved receptors

In alcohol dependence, a downregulation of GABAergic receptors occurs as a compensatory response to the continuous GABAergic stimulation by ethanol. This causes tolerance and leads to patients with alcohol use disorder consuming increasingly higher amounts to achieve the desired sedative effect.
If an individual with alcohol dependence stops drinking, they have too few GABA receptors (inhibitory) and relatively too much glutamate activity (excitatory). This leads to tremors, anxiety, and potentially seizures.

### Learning psychology concepts of addiction development

- Classical conditioning: previously neutral environmental stimuli become associated with the drug and, over time, also trigger specific response patterns.

- For example, visiting a location associated with past drug use can trigger intense cravings.

- Operant conditioning with reinforcement mechanisms

- Positive reinforcement: taking the drug creates euphoria (dopamine spike) → repeated use to feel better

- Negative reinforcement: taking the drug removes the pain of withdrawal or anxiety → repeated use to stop feeling bad

- Observational learning: Addiction can be learned by observing role models (parents, peers) engaging in drug use without perceived negative consequences (social cognitive theory).

### Genetic factors in addiction development

- Addiction is highly heritable (polygenic)

- Genetic variants often involve dopamine receptor density or metabolism efficacy

Addiction is not solely a physical dependence, but the complex intersection of biological predispositions (genetics/dopamine), psychological states (impulsivity/comorbidity), and environmental contexts (socioeconomic status/peers).

### Management of substance use disorder

### SUD screening [9]

## Indications

- Tobacco use: all adults and pregnant individuals [10]

- Unhealthy alcohol use: adults in primary care settings [11]

- Unhealthy drug use: adults, if treatment can be offered  [12]

## Validated screening tools

- Alcohol use disorders identification test-concise (AUDIT-C)  [11]

- Single alcohol screening question (SASQ) [11]

- Tobacco, alcohol, prescription medication, and other substance use tool (TAPS) [12]

- National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) quick screen [12]

The harms of screening for unhealthy drug use outweigh the benefits when treatment cannot be provided or when findings may result in punitive actions (e.g., some US state laws penalize pregnant individuals who use substances or seek addiction treatment). [12]
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C)

### SUD assessment [6]

- Indications

- Positive SUD screening

- History of SUD

- Classic toxidrome or findings that suggest drug intoxication or withdrawal, e.g.:

- Altered mental status, acute agitation

- Acute cardiopulmonary symptoms

- Needle or track marks

- Prior to initiating a long-term opioid or benzodiazepine prescription

- Components

- Cravings and withdrawal symptoms

- Reasons, amount, frequency, route, and duration of substance use

- Impact on overall well-being

- Prior experiences with treatment, including:

- Facilitators (e.g., coping skills, recovery supports)

- Barriers (e.g., triggers, mobility impairment, health literacy)

- Current level of interest in treatment

- Further evaluation

- Screen all patients for coexisting disorders (e.g., intimate partner violence, mood disorders, anxiety).

- Consider drug testing if results will impact management.

The screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model may be used to identify and assess SUD in any care setting. [6]

### Drug testing [13][14]

- Definition: the testing of biological samples for the presence of drugs and drug metabolites

## Urine drug test

- Overview

- Immunoassay testing is the most frequently used method for urine drug testing.

- Mass spectrometry/gas chromatography is used to confirm immunoassay results.

- Example situations for the use of a urine drug test include workup of altered mental status and monitoring during SUD treatment or chronic opioid therapy.

- Detectable substances (immunoassay)

- Phencyclidine (PCP)

- Opioids

- THC (marijuana)

- Cocaine

- Amphetamine

- Undetectable substances (immunoassay)

- GHB

- MDMA

- Semisynthetic and synthetic opioids

- Ketamine

- Psilocybin (hallucinogenic mushrooms), DMT (ayahuasca), mescaline (peyote)

- Synthetic drugs

- Substances that can cause cross-reactivity and yield false positive results [15]

- Marijuana: food containing hemp

- PCP: doxylamine, dextromethorphan, tramadol

- Opioids: poppy seeds, rifampin

- Benzodiazepines: sertraline

- Amphetamines: pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, metformin

Urine drug test immunoassays can generate false-positive and false-negative results because of cross-reactivity with other medications (e.g., rifampin with opioid assays, sertraline with benzodiazepines, metformin with amphetamines). [13]

## Blood/serum drug test

- Usage: assess intoxication or impairment in emergency situations

- Examples: drug overdosage, after motor vehicle crash

## Laboratory methods

- Immunoassays

- Rapid presumptive results for many substances (e.g., point-of-care urine drug tests)

- Provide quantitative results

- Can generate false-positive and/or false-negative results

- Mass spectrometry

- Often obtained based on a presumptive positive result

- Definitive results

- Can provide quantitative drug levels

Always confirm qualitative point-of-care drug test results (i.e., with mass spectrometry) when the results might have legal, financial, or employment implications.

### Management

- Treatment options depend on the respective substance being used (e.g., “Management of alcohol withdrawal” and “Opioid withdrawal”) and patient preferences.

- Utilize person-centered language, motivational interviewing, and strategies for harm reduction in OUD. [16]

- Manage withdrawal, if present.

- Medication-assisted treatment (MAT): treatment for substance use disorder that combines counseling with pharmacological and behavioral therapy, tailored to each patient's needs.  [6]

## Disposition [17][18]

The most appropriate treatment setting may change over time and is influenced by: [19]

- The presence and severity of withdrawal symptoms and/or comorbid conditions

- Patient preference and social history

- Current circumstances

- Social support

- Need for medication oversight (e.g., methadone)

## Withdrawal management settings [17][18]

| Overview |
| --- |
| Setting | Indications | Description |
| Hospital withdrawal management | Significant comorbidities, e.g.: Sepsis Co-ingestions Suicidality Heart failure Need for 24-hour respiratory and/or hemodynamic monitoring, e.g.: Severe withdrawal symptoms Clinically unstable High medication dosages | Inpatient treatment program Daily physician evaluations Addiction services |
| Residential | Severe withdrawal Need for 24-hour support Outpatient withdrawal treatment is neither safe nor feasible. | Inpatient treatment program Access to a physician Addiction services |
| Intensive outpatient | Patients with: Need for daily support Reliable means to access care (e.g., transportation) A supportive living environment | Outpatient programs in specialized centers High patient oversight Direct administration of medications (e.g., methadone) |
| Outpatient | Stable patients with: Less than daily support needs A secure living environment High general functioning | Home or clinic setting Lower patient oversight than intensive outpatient WM Physicians prescribe medications for outpatient use. |

Forced treatment is not recommended as it is often followed by relapse and a loss of trust in treatment services and providers.

- ≥ 4 of the following criteria are present in a 12-month period, and behavior is not due to a manic episode:

- Using increasing amounts of money to gamble

- Restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop gambling

- Multiple failed attempts to quit gambling

- Frequent preoccupation with gambling

- Gambling when feeling helpless, guilty, anxious, or depressed

- Repeated gambling in an attempt to undo losses (“chasing one's losses”)

- Lying to conceal the extent of gambling

- Relying on others for financial support to maintain habit

- Jeopardizing relationships or career as a result of gambling

- Severity is based on the number of criteria met.

- Mild: 4–5

- Moderate: 6–7

- Severe: 8–9

### Treatment [40][41]

- Treat comorbidities, e.g.:   [1][40][41]

- Treatment of alcohol use disorder (e.g., with naltrexone)

- Treatment of bipolar disorder (e.g., with lithium)

- Treatment of depression (e.g., with an SSRI)

- Refer for psychosocial interventions, e.g.: [42][43]

- Motivational interviewing

- Cognitive behavioral therapy

- Provide information on community resources, e.g.:

- Gamblers Anonymous  [40]

- National Problem Gambling Helpline to provide support and information on support services

- In consultation with a psychiatrist, consider off-label use of an opioid receptor antagonist (e.g., naltrexone).  [44][45]

Offer a combination of interventions to increase the likelihood of recovery. [40][41]

## Patients not currently interested in treatment

- Offer treatment for psychiatric comorbidities.

- Consider a brief intervention for gambling. [40][46]

- Advise patients they can return at any point to start treatment.

### Complications [1]

- Suicidal ideation and behavior [40]

- Associated with poor general health, including tachycardia and angina [1]

### Pharmacology

- Substances (street names: G, Georgia home boy, liquid ecstasy, liquid X) [47][48]

- GHB: recreational drug used to induce euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced empathy, and/or increased libido  [48]

- GHB is also used as a performance-enhancing drug by athletes.  [49]

- Mechanism of action: direct agonist of GABA receptors (similar to benzodiazepines) [50]

- Pharmacokinetics [47][48]

- Onset: 15–20 minutes

- Peak effect: 30–60 minutes

- Half-life: 20–50 minutes (dose-dependent)

GHB is sometimes used in drug-facilitated sexual assault because of its rapid onset, amnesic effect, and difficult detection. [47][48]

### Risky substance use

- Acute intoxication: See “GHB intoxication and overdose.”

- Chronic GHB use and dependence [51]

- Most common in young men

- Tolerance can cause dose escalation, which increases the risk of GHB overdose.

- Withdrawal symptoms can lead to frequent reuse (e.g., every few hours).

### GHB withdrawal [47][52]

Abrupt cessation of chronic GHB use can precipitate a potentially fatal withdrawal syndrome.

## Clinical features [47][52]

The clinical features of GHB withdrawal are similar to those of alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal. [47]

- CNS stimulation: tremor, increased muscle tone, seizures, coma

- Neuropsychiatric changes

- Insomnia, irritability, anxiety, agitation, psychosis

- Confusion, delirium, hallucinations

- Autonomic stimulation: tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis

- GI: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea

Features of GHB withdrawal may appear as early as 1–6 hours after the last ingestion and persist for over 14 days. [47]

## Management [47][52]

- Begin high-dose benzodiazepine therapy (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam).

- Urgently consult psychiatry or addiction medicine to guide pharmacotherapy.  [47][53]

- Consider admission to the ICU for severe symptoms or if high doses of sedatives are required.

- Monitor for complications including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperthermia.

Acute GHB withdrawal is a medical emergency and may result in death if not appropriately diagnosed and managed. [47][52]
