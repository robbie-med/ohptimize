### Summary

Nontraumatic chest pain is one of the most common reasons that patients visit the emergency department; it is also frequently encountered in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes cardiac (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, pericarditis), gastrointestinal (e.g., gastritis, peptic ulcer disease), pulmonary (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax), musculoskeletal (e.g., costochondritis, rib contusion), and psychiatric (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder) etiologies. Patients with red flag features suggestive of life-threatening causes (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism) and those who are hemodynamically unstable require immediate assessment. Once life-threatening causes have been ruled out (either by patient history, examination, or rapid diagnostics), a more thorough history and examination should be performed to narrow the differential diagnosis and guide further diagnostic workup and therapy.
For traumatic causes of chest pain, see “Blunt chest trauma” and “Penetrating chest trauma.”

### Initial management

The following recommendations are consistent with the 2021 American Heart Association (AHA) chest pain guidelines. [1]
Life-threatening causes of acute chest pain

### Approach [1][2][3]

- All patients

- ABCDE survey

- Focused clinical evaluation

- 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of patient arrival

- IV access

- Routine diagnostic studies (e.g., troponin, CXR)

- Identify and treat the underlying cause.

- Red flags for chest pain present: i.e., high risk of critical causes of chest pain

- Perform POCUS (e.g., eFAST, focused cardiac ultrasound, lung POCUS).   [1][4]

- Begin time-sensitive management (e.g., activate cath lab for STEMI).

- Obtain definitive imaging (e.g., CTA chest for TAA).

- Consider urgent specialty consult and critical care unit admission.

- Red flags for chest pain absent: i.e., low risk of critical causes of chest pain

- Consider additional studies (see “Diagnostics for chest pain”).

- Use risk stratification tools, e.g.:

- HEART score for risk stratification for ACS (See also “Decision pathway for possible NSTE-ACS.”)

- Wells score for PE (See also “PE diagnostics.”)

- Consider inpatient admission if the diagnosis is uncertain or clinical suspicion of a critical cause persists.

Begin management of hemodynamic instability (e.g., shock, hypertensive emergency), signs of respiratory distress, and/or respiratory failure (e.g., hypoxia, hypercapnia) as soon as they are identified.

### Red flags in chest pain [1][5]

- Symptoms

- Sudden onset

- Exertional chest pain

- Substernal or left-sided pain

- Radiation to the left arm, jaw, and/or back

- Quality of chest pain: crushing, pressure , tearing, and/or ripping

- Associated symptoms: shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, and/or vomiting

- Signs

- Vital sign abnormalities (e.g., hypoxia, hypotension)

- Pulsus paradoxus

- Difference of > 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure between arms [5]

- New murmur

- Chest wall crepitus

- Distant heart sounds

Chest tightness with radiation to the left arm, jaw, and/or back that is associated with dyspnea should be considered cardiac chest pain until proven otherwise. [1]

### Immediately life-threatening causes of chest pain [1]

- Acute coronary syndrome (i.e., STEMI, NSTEMI, unstable angina)

- Pulmonary embolism

- Aortic dissection

- Tension pneumothorax

- Cardiac tamponade

### Diagnosis

The diagnostic evaluation of undifferentiated chest pain aims to first rule out immediately life-threatening causes of chest pain and then determine the etiology, guided by the pretest probability of the diagnoses under consideration.

### ECG

- Obtain 12-lead ECG as soon as possible.

- Evaluate for:

- STEMI and STEMI equivalents

- Conduction abnormalities, e.g., tachyarrhythmias, heart block

- Findings of systemic disorders and anatomic abnormalities

- See “Life-threatening ECG findings” for details and examples.

Perform a 12-lead ECG for all patients with new or evolving chest pain as soon as possible, e.g., for timely identification of acute coronary syndrome.
Types of ST-segment elevation

### Laboratory studies

## Routine investigations

Applicable to most patients with undifferentiated chest pain

- Troponin  [6]

- CBC

- BMP

## Additional investigations

Consider ordering the following studies concurrently with routine studies based on clinical assessment and pretest probability:

- BNP or NT-proBNP

- D-dimer

- Lactate

- Preoperative studies: PT, PTT, type and screen

- Abdominal studies: LFTs , lipase, amylase

- Acute phase reactants: ESR, CRP , procalcitonin

- Cultures: blood cultures, sputum cultures

- Acute viral hepatitis panel

- Respiratory viral panel

- Urine toxicology screen

### Imaging

Imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out differential diagnoses. The choice of initial modality is usually based on the patient's clinical status, the pretest probability of the underlying etiology, and resource availability.

## Bedside investigations

The following studies can be performed on unstable patients in most emergency settings:

- Portable CXR (anteroposterior view)

- POCUS [1][4]

- Focused cardiac ultrasound

- Lung POCUS

- eFAST

- Biliary POCUS

- POCUS for suspected AAA

- Lung ultrasound

- Portable abdominal x-ray (upright)

- Echocardiography (e.g., TTE, TEE)

## Additional investigations

The following studies typically require the patient to be stable enough for transfer to a dedicated imaging suite:

- CXR (posteroanterior and lateral; rib series if there is concern for rib fracture)

- Abdominal series x-ray

- CT chest (with IV contrast)

- CTA chest (pulmonary embolism protocol)

- CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis (to evaluate the aorta)

- Ultrasound right upper quadrant

- Lower extremity venous ultrasound

- V/Q scan
