# Back pain

### Quick guide

### Diagnostic approach

Focused clinical evaluation

Order tests based on the suspected etiology of back pain or presence of red flags for back pain.

Cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome: MRI L-spine without IV contrast

Vertebral fracture: CT spine without contrast

Spinal epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis: CBC, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, MRI with and without IV contrast

Aortic dissection or AAA rupture: CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis

Spinal epidural hematoma: CBC, PT, PTT, MRI with and without IV contrast

Malignancy: MRI with and without IV contrast

See “Approach to imaging in back pain.”

Diagnostic testing is not routinely indicated for acute back pain.

### Management checklist

Most cases of acute, nonspecific back pain improve without intervention.

Treat acute complications (e.g., Foley catheter placement for acute urinary retention).

Treat the underlying cause.

Conservative management of nonspecific back pain (e.g. NSAIDs).

Order spinal precautions for suspected fracture.

See “Management of traumatic back pain.”

See “Management of compressive spinal emergencies.”

### Summary
Back pain is experienced by most adults. The majority of cases are benign, nonspecific back pain (pain that is not attributable to a specific pathology). Spinal causes of acute back pain are conditions of the spinal column or surrounding muscles and soft tissue. Spinal causes include conditions that require urgent management to prevent or minimize permanent neurological dysfunction (e.g., spinal cord compression, spinal infections) and nonurgent causes (e.g., inflammatory arthritis, bone metastases without cord compression or unstable vertebral fracture). Nonspinal causes of back pain is referred pain from a thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, retroperitoneal, or cardiovascular cause. Assessment for red flag features of back pain and a focused neurological examination is required in all patients. Initial diagnostics and management should be guided by the pretest probability of the underlying condition. Patients with new neurological findings other than isolated unilateral radiculopathy require immediate imaging, typically MRI, and urgent spinal surgery consultation. Serious and life-threatening nonspinal causes, such as myocardial infarction and aortic pathology, should be considered particularly in patients with abnormal vital signs and no neurological abnormalities. Neurologically intact patients without red flags do not require urgent imaging and typically improve with nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g., superficial application of heat, massage), symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs, and early mobilization.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Classification

### By etiology [2][3]

- Specific back pain

- Back pain attributable to a pathophysiological condition (e.g., trauma, deformity, disease, injury, or infection); see “Etiology” section for details.

- Mechanical back pain: specific back pain caused by disorders of the spine, intervertebral discs, or surrounding soft tissue  [4]

- Nonspecific back pain: back pain that cannot be attributed to a specific cause after a full evaluation.

- Spinal causes: conditions of the spinal column or surrounding muscles and soft tissue

- Nonspinal causes: include thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, retroperitoneal, or cardiovascular conditions that can manifest with referred pain to the back.

### By duration [2][5][6]

- Acute back pain: pain lasting ≤ 4 weeks

- Subacute back pain: pain lasting 4–12 weeks

- Chronic back pain: persistent or recurring back pain lasting > 12 weeks

### By location

- Low back pain (LBP) [2][3]

- Pain localized to the lumbar region (below the costal margin) and above the gluteal folds; may be associated with pain that radiates down the legs

- LBP is typically further classified into three broad categories: [7]

- Nonspecific LBP (most common)  [8]

- LBP associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis

- LBP associated with a specific spinal cause (see “Spinal causes of back pain”)

- Upper back pain: pain localized to the thoracic spine region

### By severity [9]

- Uncomplicated back pain: no red flag features of back pain

- Complicated back pain: presence of red flag features of back pain

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Epidemiology

- 2–3% of visits to the ED are for acute nontraumatic back pain. [10]

- In the US, low back pain affects up to 85% of individuals and, worldwide, is the leading cause of years lived with disability.  [11][12][13]

Epidemiological data refers to the US, unless otherwise specified.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Etiology

Trauma can cause both spinal and nonspinal causes of back pain.

### Red flags for back pain

Red flag features on history or clinical examination indicate an urgent or serious underlying etiology.
Maximize table Table Quiz
| Red flags for back pain [2][8][10] |
| --- |
|  | Features |
| Patient characteristics | Age < 18 or > 50 years  Immunosuppression |
| Relevant medical history | History of cancer or unexplained weight loss  [8] History of abdominal aortic aneurysm Recent history of any of the following: Bacterial infection  [14] Spinal anesthesia Spinal surgery [15] Significant trauma related to age  [2] |
| Medication use | Long-term glucocorticoid use  Anticoagulants  IV drug use  [15] |
| Pain characteristics | Pain that does not improve with rest and/or worsens at night Persistent or progressive pain and/or neurological findings despite > 4 weeks of conservative therapy |
| Examination findings | Fever Abnormal vitals Signs of aortic pathology (e.g., aortic regurgitation, unequal blood pressures)  Signs of cord compression syndromes (spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, conus medullaris syndrome), such as: [16] Motor weakness Spasticity and hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron signs) distal to the site of compression Flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia (lower motor neuron signs) can occur distal to the site of compression in spinal shock. [17] Paresthesias or anesthesia (including saddle anesthesia)  Bladder, bowel, or sexual dysfunction |

Hypotension and bradycardia in a patient with signs of spinal cord compression are likely indicators of spinal shock. [18]
Pathological fractures, bone metastases, or referred pain (e.g., myocardial infarction, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection) are more likely in older individuals with back pain.
CollapseNotesFeedback
### Initial management

- Perform focused clinical history and examination.

- Assess for red flag features of back pain and risk stratify accordingly.

- Low suspicion for serious or urgent etiology: supportive care, pain management, close follow-up and return precautions usually sufficient  [8]

- High suspicion for serious or urgent etiology: targeted and expedited evaluation to identify and treat the underlying cause, e.g., [10][19]

- Concern for spinal infection: urgent MRI with and without IV contrast, empiric antibiotics, neurosurgery consult

- Concern for compressive spinal emergency: urgent MRI spine with and without IV contrast, urgent neurosurgery consult; See “Management of compressive spinal emergencies.”

- Suspected fracture: spinal precautions, XR spine; See “Management of traumatic back pain.”

- Evaluate and treat the underlying cause.

- Administer analgesics (preferably NSAIDs) after baseline neurological function and pain severity are documented. [7][10]

Most cases of acute, nonspecific back pain do not require imaging and improve without intervention. [20]
Acute spinal cord compression is a surgical emergency. Obtain immediate MRI or CT myelography, give IV glucocorticoids for malignant compression, and decompress the cord (e.g., with surgery) as soon as possible!

### Diagnosis

### Imaging [6][7][21][22]

- Indications for imaging may include: [6]

- Suspicion of a serious underlying etiology

- Pain that persists despite at least 4–6 weeks of conservative management.

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Approach to imaging in back pain [6][7] |
| --- |
| Suspected urgent spinal cause (e.g., severe or progressive neurological deficits, features of spinal infection, features of spinal malignancy, cauda equina) | Urgent MRI spine without and with IV contrast Post-void bladder scan |
| Suspected inflammatory cause (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis) | X-ray spine |
| Suspected vertebral fracture | X-ray spine OR CT spine without contrast OR MRI spine without contrast |
| Isolated radiculopathy and/or clinical features of spinal stenosis without any red flags | Imaging typically not required for acute symptoms  [6] Consider MRI spine without IV contrast if symptoms progress or persist despite 4–6 weeks of conservative management.  [6] |
| Suspected nonspinal causes of back pain | Depends on suspected etiology |
| Nonspecific back pain | Imaging not routinely required Consider MRI spine and possibly x-ray if pain persists for > 6 weeks despite therapy and the patient is a surgical candidate. [6] |

In patients presenting with acute back pain without red flags or neurological deficits, imaging is not typically indicated. [7]

### Laboratory studies

- Laboratory studies are not routinely required for the evaluation of acute or chronic back pain.

- Consider obtaining laboratory studies based on the likely underlying etiology and/or the presence of red flags for back pain, e.g.:

- CBC and inflammatory markers: for suspected spinal infections, inflammatory arthritis, or malignancy

- Blood cultures: for suspected spinal infections

- Serum calcium and vitamin D levels: for suspected fragility fractures

CollapseNotesFeedback
### Urgent spinal causes of acute back pain

- Urgent spinal causes of back pain include conditions that cause, or have the potential to cause, permanent neurological damage or life-threatening complications.

- Immediate management is required for patients with severe and/or progressive neurological deficits.  [10]

| Spinal infections [26] | Risk factors for spinal infection Fever, rigors Tender point Limited spine mobility Signs of spinal cord compression | ↑ WBC and inflammatory markers Blood cultures : Staphylococcus aureus (most common) [26] Urgent MRI with and without IV contrast: inflammation, abscess : [6] | Empiric antibiotic therapy for spinal infection Urgent neurosurgery evaluation |
| Spinal epidural hematoma causing cord compression [27] | Possible history of: Thrombocytopenia Bleeding disorders Use of anticoagulants Vascular malformations Localized trauma (e.g., following lumbar puncture, pulling of the epidural catheter) | MRI with and without IV contrast  [28] Blood in the epidural space with a smooth contour  [28] Loss of epidural fat signal | Strict bed rest Anticoagulant reversal, if indicated Urgent neurosurgery consult for surgical decompression (laminectomy and evacuation of blood) |

Acute urinary retention in a patient with sudden back pain and neurological deficits is strongly suggestive of cauda equina syndrome (90% sensitivity). [7]
Spinal boards should only be used for transport; remove patients from them on arrival at the hospital to reduce pain and prevent the development of pressure ulcers!

### Compressive spinal emergencies

The following table outlines common symptoms following compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina. Patients may also present with symptoms of incomplete spinal cord syndromes depending on the location of compression.
Spinal cord compression, conus medullaris syndrome, and cauda equina syndrome are medical emergencies that have the potential to cause permanent neurological damage. [10]
Maximize table Table Quiz
| Overview of compressive myelopathies  [17] |

|  | Spinal cord compression | Conus medullaris syndrome | Cauda equina syndrome |
| Etiology | Damage to or compression of the spinal cord at any level due to: Degenerative disc disease Neoplasms Vertebral metastases Trauma (epidural hematoma, vertebral fracture) Epidural abscess | Damage to or compression of the spinal cord at the vertebral level T12–L2, resulting in injury to the conus medullaris (sacral and coccygeal spinal segments)  [29][30] Common causes include spondylolisthesis, tumors, and trauma (e.g., vertebral fracture). | Damage to or compression of the cauda equina (nerve fibers L3–S5) located below L2  Common causes include large posteromedial disc herniation, trauma, and tumors. |
| Onset | Variable, bilateral | Sudden, bilateral | Gradual, typically unilateral |
| Pain | Localized neck or back pain | Lower back pain Less severe radicular pain | Lower back pain Severe radicular pain |
| Motor symptoms | Bilateral paralysis below the affected level of the spinal cord Hyperreflexia Positive Babinski sign Ataxia | Symmetric, hyperreflexic distal paresis of lower limbs, possibly fasciculations Achilles reflex may be absent. | Asymmetric, areflexic, flaccid paresis of the legs  Muscle atrophy |
| Sensory symptoms | Loss or reduction of all sensation below the affected level of the spinal cord | Symmetric bilateral perianal numbness Sensory dissociation | Saddle anesthesia: lack of sensitivity in the dermatomes S3–S5, affecting the areas around the anus, genitalia, and inner thighs (may be asymmetric)  Asymmetric unilateral numbness and/or paresthesia in lower limb dermatomes |
| Urogenital and rectal symptoms | Sphincter dysfunction with urinary or bowel urgency, retention, or incontinence | Early onset of bladder and fecal incontinence  Erectile dysfunction | Late onset of urinary retention Change in bowel habits due to loss of anal sphincter control Decreased rectal tone or bulbocavernosus reflex Erectile dysfunction |

Conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromesSaddle anesthesia
Cauda equina syndrome typically manifests with lower motor neuron signs. Spinal cord compression and conus medullaris manifest with a combination of lower motor neuron signs (at the level of compression) and upper motor neuron signs (below the level of compression).

### Management of compressive spinal emergencies

- Urgent MRI spine without contrast

- Consult neurosurgery for urgent surgical decompression.

- Document the patient's current neurological deficits and reassess frequently.  [31]

- Bladder scan to evaluate postvoid residual; Insert Foley catheter for patients with urinary retention.

- Administer analgesics (preferably NSAIDs, see “Pain management”). [7][10]

- Treat the underlying cause (e.g., suspected malignant cord compression: high-dose IV dexamethasoneDOSAGE  ) [32]

- Admit the patient for frequent neurological examinations and definitive management.

Treatment of acute spinal cord compression varies based on the underlying etiology and may include decompressive surgery (e.g., for disc herniation) or IV steroids and radiation therapy (for malignant compression).

### Nonspecific back pain

Nonspecific back pain is the most common type of back pain and accounts for the majority of cases of low back pain (LBP). [7]

### Definition

- Pain that cannot be attributed to an underlying disease or structural lesion after a full evaluation

### Risk factors [3][64]

- Poor posture

- Sedentary lifestyle, low level of physical activity

- Heavy lifting

- Older age

- Psychological stressors (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression)

- History of lumbar surgery  [6]

### Clinical features [4][7][8]

- Typically LBP

- Evaluation of back pain does not reveal an underlying cause.

- No red flags for back pain [10]

- Normal neurological examination [8]

- No features suggestive of specific back pain (e.g., negative straight leg raise test)

- Usually resolves spontaneously within 6 weeks [2][65]

### Imaging [3][4][6]

Imaging is not routinely recommended for the evaluation of nonspecific LBP.

- Indications

- Progressive symptoms during conservative management

- Persistent symptoms despite 6 weeks of conservative management (if the patient is a surgical candidate)

- Modalities

- MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast

- X-ray lumbosacral spine

- CT lumbar spine without IV contrast

### Management [2][3][4][5][66][67]

- Reassure patients and provide patient education.

- Initiate conservative management alone or in combination with nonselective NSAIDs.

- For patients with risk factors for chronic back pain, consider more intensive therapy and multidisciplinary involvement.

- Reassess symptoms in 4–6 weeks or earlier if symptoms worsen during conservative management.

- Persistent symptoms despite 6 weeks of conservative management

- Consider alternative causes of back pain.

- Consider imaging for back pain if there is diagnostic uncertainty or to evaluate candidacy if surgery is being considered. [6]

- Consider referral to specialists.  [2]

## Patient education [2][4][5][66]

- Maintain daily activities, including work and sports; avoid bed rest.  [2][10]

- Stretching, exercises, and appropriate ergonomics for LBP

- Avoid movements that aggravate pain

- Reassurance and expectation management

- Self-management of pain

## Conservative management of nonspecific back pain and analgesia [2][3][4][5][66]

- Conservative management is the preferred, first-line management of nonspecific LBP.

- When analgesics are required, nonselective NSAIDs are preferred.

- In older adults, avoid skeletal muscle relaxants and use NSAIDs with caution because of the risk of adverse effects; see “Principles of pharmacotherapy for older adults.” [5]

- Glucocorticoids and back traction are not recommended for the treatment of back pain. [2][66]

### Acute and subacute LBP

- Assess for risk factors for chronic back pain, which include:  [2][3][7][68]

- Severe pain and functional impairment [2]

- Psychosocial and workplace factors  [2][69][70]

- Previous episodes of LBP [2]

- Use of non-evidence-based management  [68]

- Patients at low risk for chronic back pain: [68]

- Initial conservative management

- Superficial heat and/or massage

- Spinal manipulation

- Acupuncture

- Pain management

- Preferred: nonselective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen  DOSAGE , naproxen DOSAGE )  [2][5][71][72]

- Alternatives: Consider a short-term (< 3 weeks) nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxant, e.g., cyclobenzaprine. DOSAGE  [3][5]

- Patients with risk factors for chronic back pain: Consider more intensive initial multidisciplinary rehabilitation.  [3][7]

Patients with risk factors for chronic back pain are likely to benefit from early multidisciplinary rehabilitation rather than reassurance and patient education alone. [7][68]

### Chronic LBP or patients at high risk for chronic LBP

- Initial conservative management [3]

- Behavioral therapy

- Structured exercise programs

- Mobility assistive devices if needed

- Consider adjunctive therapies.  [2][5][66]

- Pain management

- Preferred: nonselective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen DOSAGE , naproxen DOSAGE )  [2][5][71][72]

- Alternative: Consider short-term (< 3 months) topical capsicum. [2][66]

- Avoid routine use of:

- Adjuvant analgesics (e.g., skeletal muscle relaxants, antidepressants)  [2][3][5][66][73]

- Opioids (see “Opioids for chronic noncancer pain”)  [2][5][66]

## Interventional therapy [2][4][74]

- Interventional therapy is rarely required for nonspecific LBP; Refer patients with refractory disabling LBP to specialists (e.g., spine surgeons) for consideration of interventional management.

- Possible benefit: radiofrequency ablation

- Limited evidence of benefit: epidural steroid injections, spinal cord stimulation, surgery (e.g., discectomy, SI joint fusion)

Regular exercise combined with patient education (e.g., on posture, safe techniques for lifting and handling, and muscle strengthening) are effective preventive measures for back pain. [75][76][77]

### Traumatic back pain

### Etiology

- Major trauma: e.g., motor vehicle accidents, direct high-impact injuries, fall from a height in a young, otherwise healthy individual

- Minor trauma in individuals at risk of fragility fractures: low-impact injuries, such as a minor fall or lifting heavy weights

### Management of traumatic back pain

- Polytrauma patients: See “Management of trauma patients.”

- Spinal immobilization if the likelihood of unstable vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression is high

- Administer analgesics (preferably NSAIDs) after baseline neurological function and pain severity are documented (see “Pain management”).

- Obtain urgent spinal surgery or neurosurgery consult in patients with new or progressive neurological abnormalities.

- Obtain imaging. [78]

- Preferred initial imaging modality: CT thoracic and lumbar spine without IV contrast .

- Thoracolumbar injury detected on CT:

- MRI thoracic and lumbar spine without IV contrast

- Alternatively, CT myelogram to identify spinal cord compression or injury (see “Urgent spinal causes of back pain”)

- Further management depends on imaging findings

Consider imaging the entire spine, as injuries may occur at multiple levels.

### Complications

- Vertebral fractures

- Intervertebral disc prolapse

- Spinal epidural hematoma

- Acute spinal cord compression (due to any of the above causes)

- Soft tissue injury
