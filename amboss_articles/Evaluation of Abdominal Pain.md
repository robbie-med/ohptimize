### Summary

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas most commonly caused by gallstones or alcohol use in adults and biliary disease and medications in children. The typical manifestation includes sudden, severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back, nausea and vomiting, and epigastric tenderness on palpation. Elevation of serum lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN and/or characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging (e.g., abdominal ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT abdomen) confirm the diagnosis. Clinical scores (e.g., Ranson criteria, APACHE II) are used to predict the severity and prognosis of pancreatitis. Initial management is primarily supportive and includes fluid resuscitation, analgesia, antiemetics, and early enteral nutrition as tolerated. The underlying cause should be identified and managed to prevent recurrence (e.g., cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis, long-term lipid-lowering therapy for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis). Localized complications of pancreatitis include necrosis (necrotizing pancreatitis), which may become infected, pancreatic pseudocysts, and walled-off necrosis. Systemic complications include sepsis, ARDS, organ failure, and shock. Complications of pancreatitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

### Etiology

### Most common causes [1]

- Biliary pancreatitis (∼ 40% of cases; mostly caused by gallstones)

- Alcohol-induced (∼ 20% of cases)

- Idiopathic (∼ 25% of cases)

### Other causes [1]

- Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis: caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1,000 mg/dL)

- Hypercalcemia

- Post-ERCP

- Drug-induced pancreatitis

- Steroids

- Azathioprine

- Sulfonamides

- Loop and thiazide diuretics

- Estrogen

- Protease inhibitors

- NRTIs

- Anticonvulsants (e.g., valproate)

- Metronidazole

- Scorpion stings

- Viral infections (e.g., coxsackievirus B, mumps)

- Trauma (especially in children)

- Autoimmune and rheumatological disorders (e.g., Sjögren syndrome)

- Pancreas divisum

- Hereditary (e.g., mutation of PRSS1 gene, cystic fibrosis) [2]

- Cholesterol embolism

I GET SMASHED: Idiopathic, Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune, Scorpion venom, Hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia, ERCP, and Drugs are causes of acute pancreatitis.

### Pathophysiology

### Sequence of events

- Intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes: secondary to pancreatic ductal outflow obstruction (e.g., gallstones, cystic fibrosis) or direct injury to pancreatic acinar cells (e.g., alcohol, drugs)

- Increased proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity → destruction of pancreatic parenchyma

- Attraction of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages) → release of inflammatory cytokines → pancreatic inflammation (pancreatitis)

### Sequelae of pancreatitis

- Capillary leakage: release of inflammatory cytokines and vascular injury by pancreatic enzymes → vasodilation and increased vascular permeability → shift of fluid from the intravascular space into the interstitial space (third-space fluid loss) → hypotension, tachycardia, warm and flushed skin → distributive shock

- In severe cases, the third spacing of fluid from this inflammatory response can lead to hypovolemic shock.

- Pancreatic necrosis: uncorrected hypotension and third-spacing → decreased end-organ perfusion → multiorgan dysfunction (mainly renal) and pancreatic necrosis

- Hypocalcemia: lipase breaks down peripancreatic and mesenteric fat;  → release of free fatty acids that bind calcium → hypocalcemia (fatty saponification) [3]

### Diagnosis

### Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis [4][5][6]

Two of the three following criteria should be met for a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis to be made.

- Characteristic abdominal pain

- ↑ Serum pancreatic enzymes: lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN

- Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging (e.g., abdominal ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT abdomen)

### Approach [7][8][9]

- All patients

- Perform laboratory studies to:

- Establish the diagnosis: serum lipase and/or amylase levels

- Determine severity: CBC, BMP, ABG, LDH, inflammatory markers, serum calcium

- Evaluate for the underlying etiology: liver chemistries, serum or plasma triglyceride levels

- Obtain ultrasound abdomen.

- Diagnostic uncertainty: Perform contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) abdomen.

- Confirmed diagnosis

- Perform further diagnostics as needed to determine the etiology (e.g., MRCP for suspected biliary pancreatitis).

- Calculate severity scores of acute pancreatitis to estimate severity and prognosis.

- In patients with severe pancreatitis, consider CECT abdomen 5–7 days after the onset of symptoms to assess for necrotizing pancreatitis.

Simultaneously conduct tests to establish the diagnosis, assess severity, and rule out differential diagnoses of acute abdominal pain.
Acute pancreatitis is a medical emergency; begin fluid resuscitation as soon as it is suspected.

### Laboratory studies

Maximize table Table Quiz
| Laboratory studies in acute pancreatitis |
| --- |
| Test | Findings and interpretation |
| Serum pancreatic enzymes [4][5][10] | ↑ Lipase: ≥ 3× ULN is highly indicative of acute pancreatitis  ↑ Amylase: ≥ 3× ULN (less sensitive and specific than lipase) |
| CBC | ↑ Hematocrit (Hct): marker of hemoconcentration Serial measurements: to guide IV fluid therapy with the aim of normalizing levels [7][11] Persistently elevated Hct: third space fluid loss suggesting inadequate fluid resuscitation [12] Sudden decrease in Hct: can indicate pancreatic hemorrhage (rare)  [13] ↑ WBC count Can be seen in early pancreatitis (a marker of severity) Worsening leukocytosis on serial evaluation is indicative of infected necrosis. [14][15] |
| BMP | ↑ Markers of volume status and tissue perfusion  [11] Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  Creatinine Lactate ↑ Blood glucose  [16] Abnormal serum calcium Hypocalcemia: indicates saponification  [16][17] Hypercalcemia: can cause acute pancreatitis  [8][18] |
| Inflammatory markers [10][11] | ↑ CRP: Levels > 150 mg/L 3 days after onset can indicate severe or necrotizing pancreatitis. ↑ Procalcitonin: sensitive for infected necrosis ↑ Interleukin-6 (IL-6): can be seen in infected necrosis and used as a predictor for remote organ failure |
| Liver chemistries [19][20] | Findings suggestive of biliary pancreatitis ↑ Aminotransferases: ALT > 150 U/L , AST > 3× ULN ↑ Cholestasis markers: bilirubin (total and direct), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), GGT |
| LDH [21] | ↑ LDH: a marker of severity; high levels are suggestive of necrotizing pancreatitis |
| Serum triglycerides [10][22] | ↑ Serum triglycerides: can be considered the cause of acute pancreatitis at levels > 1,000 mg/dL |

The degree of lipase and/or amylase elevation does not necessarily correlate with the severity of or prognosis for acute pancreatitis. [23]
Measure serum triglycerides promptly after symptom onset, as levels decrease rapidly with fasting. [24]
Determining calcium values is very important: Hypercalcemia may cause pancreatitis, which may then, in turn, cause hypocalcemia!

### Imaging

## Ultrasound abdomen [9][25]

- Indications: first-line imaging modality for all patients

- Supportive findings

- Features of acute pancreatitis (visible in 20% of cases) [9]

- Enlarged hypoechoic pancreas (pancreatic edema)

### Severity grading and prognostic scores

There are several scores used to assess the severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. The most commonly used and validated scores are described here.

### Revised Atlanta grades of severity [6]

The revised Atlanta grades of severity classify pancreatitis as mild, moderately severe, or severe, depending on the presence of organ failure. Organ failure can be determined using the modified Marshall scoring system for organ dysfunction.

- Mild acute pancreatitis: no organ failure and no local or systemic complications

- Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: transient organ failure (< 48 hours) and/or local or systemic complications

- Severe acute pancreatitis: persistent organ failure (> 48 hours)

Patients with organ failure at presentation or within the first 24 hours of admission should be classified as having severe pancreatitis. If organ failure resolves within 48 hours, patients can be reclassified as having moderately severe acute pancreatitis. [6]
Modified Marshall Score

### CT severity index [8][24][32]

The CT severity index for acute pancreatitis (CTSI) and modified CT severity index (MCTSI) can be used to estimate the severity, mortality, and morbidity of acute pancreatitis based on the extent of pancreatic inflammation and necrosis on a CT abdomen performed ideally > 5–7 days (or at least 72 hours) after symptom onset.

| Interpretation | Mild: 0–3 points Moderate: 4–6 points Severe: 7–10 points | Mild: 0–2 points Moderate: 4–6 points Severe: 8–10 points |

CT severity index for acute pancreatitis

### Ranson criteria [8][28]

The Ranson criteria is one of the oldest predictive models used to estimate severity and prognosis of biliary and nonbiliary pancreatitis; , but full assessment is only possible after 48 hours, and sensitivity for predicting severity and outcome can be as low as 70%.

### Treatment

The initial management is identical for all etiologies of acute pancreatitis and should be administered without delay. For management in pregnant individuals and children, see “Special patient groups.”

### Acute stabilization [4][5][7][11]

- ABCDE survey

- Hemodynamic and respiratory support

- Maintain NPO status until potential causes of acute abdomen that require emergency surgery have been ruled out.

### Goal-directed IV fluid therapy for acute pancreatitis [4][5][7][11]

## Fluids and infusion rate [4][5][11]

- Crystalloids such as lactated Ringer's solution (LR) are preferred. [4]

- Hemodynamically stable patients [4]

- Moderately aggressive IV fluid therapy in the first 24–48 hours

- Normovolemic patients: LR 1.5 mL/kg/hour [4][36]

- Hypovolemic patients: LR 10 mL/kg bolus [4][36]

- Exercise caution in patients with renal or cardiovascular disease.

- Hemodynamically unstable patients [37]

- Administer rapid fluid bolus (e.g., LR 500–1000 mL IV bolus over 10–30 minutes).

- Repeat as needed based on response.

- See also “Fluid resuscitation” for further detail.

## Monitoring [8][12]

- Monitor vitals, oxygen saturation, and urine output every 1–2 hours during the initial period of IV fluid therapy.

- Obtain laboratory studies (CBC, BMP, HCT) every 6–12 hours to monitor adequacy of fluid resuscitation and tissue perfusion.

- Perform serial physical examination every 4–6 hours to assess for abdominal compartment syndrome.

## Fluid therapy goals in acute pancreatitis [7]

- Heart rate < 120 bpm, MAP 65–85 mm Hg

- Urine output > 0.5–1 mL/kg/hour

- Central venous pressure 8–12 mm Hg, central venous oxygen saturation ≥ 70% [38]

- Hct 35–44%

- Reduction in BUN [4]

Intravenous fluid resuscitation in the first 12–24 hours has the greatest impact on the clinical outcome of patients with acute pancreatitis. [4]

### Supportive therapy

- Analgesics: based on the WHO analgesic ladder [39]

- NSAIDS (e.g., ketorolac DOSAGE , diclofenac DOSAGE , ibuprofen DOSAGE ) [40][41]

- Opioids;  (e.g., hydromorphone DOSAGE , morphine DOSAGE ) [42]

- Consider patient-controlled analgesia for management of severe pain. [11][41]

- Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron DOSAGE , metoclopramide DOSAGE )

- Electrolyte repletion

In concurrent acute kidney injury, avoid NSAIDs and use opioids with caution because of the risk of accumulation. [11]
Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended, and should only be used in patients with evidence of infected necrosis. [4]

### Consults

- Multidisciplinary care is ideal.

- Urgent gastroenterology, surgery, and/or interventional radiology for cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, or localized complications

### Disposition [7][28]

- Hospital admission is usually required.

- Consider ICU admission in the following cases:

- Organ dysfunction or failure

- Ongoing SIRS or fluid resuscitation requirements

- Significant electrolyte imbalances

- Older age or high-risk comorbidities

- Severe pancreatitis on severity scores

- Refer to a specialist center if the need for surgical or interventional procedures is anticipated.  [7]

### Nutrition

- Early oral feeding: : low-fat, solid diet as soon as tolerated, ideally within 24 hours  [4][5][43]

- Enteral tube (nasogastric or nasojejunal): preferred over parenteral nutrition if patients cannot tolerate oral intake  [5][44]

- Parenteral nutrition (total or partial): only in patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeds (e.g., those with persistent paralytic ileus)  [45]

Bowel rest is no longer routinely recommended. Enteral nutrition, via oral route or enteral tube, should be initiated as early as tolerated. [5]

### Management of the underlying cause

## Biliary pancreatitis

- Therapeutic ERCP [5][7][38]

- Indication: biliary pancreatitis associated with cholangitis or persistent CBD obstruction

- Timing: Urgent therapeutic ERCP (within < 24 hours) is indicated if there is concurrent cholangitis.

- Procedure: sphincterotomy and stone removal; see “Treatment of choledocholithiasis”

- Complications: aggravation of pancreatitis, perforation, hemorrhage [9]

- Cholecystectomy [5][7][46]

- Indications

- All patients with biliary pancreatitis to prevent recurrence

- Consider in patients with a recurrent episode of acute pancreatitis of unclear etiology [4]

- Timing: recommended during the initial admission for patients with mild biliary pancreatitis

Urgent ERCP is not indicated in acute biliary pancreatitis unless acute cholangitis is present. [5]

## Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [24]

- Initiate measures to rapidly decrease triglyceride levels alongside fluid resuscitation and analgesia.

- Insulin therapy DOSAGE ; monitor blood glucose levels.

- Plasmapheresis and hemofiltration

- Evaluate for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia ; consider screening for familial hypertriglyceridemia if none are present.

- Long-term management

- Initiate long-term lipid-lowering therapy e.g., with fibrates, as soon as tolerated to prevent recurrences.

- Dietary and lifestyle modifications

- See “Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in adults” for details.

## Hypercalcemia-induced pancreatitis [18]

- Initial treatment: See “Treatment of hypercalcemia.”

- Definitive management: Investigate for primary hyperparathyroidism; if this is the underlying cause, perform parathyroidectomy.

## Alcohol-induced pancreatitis

- Check magnesium and phosphorus levels and replete as needed.  [8][47]

- Vitamin supplementation (thiamine, pyridoxine)

- See “Treatment of alcohol use disorder” for details.

- Provide counseling on alcohol use disorder before discharge. [5]

### Special patient groups

### Acute pancreatitis during pregnancy [48]

## Epidemiology

- Incidence is 1:1000–1:10,000 pregnancies

- More commonly affects multiparous individuals (75%)

- The majority of cases occur in the third trimester (50%), followed by the early postpartum period (38%), and the first and second trimester (12%)

## Etiology

- Most commonly gallstones, heavy alcohol use, and familial hypertriglyceridemia

- Physiologic changes during pregnancy such as altered progesterone and estrogen levels increase the risk of choledocholithiasis.

- ↑ Progesterone → ↑ pressure on the sphincter of Oddi → bile stasis

- Estrogen alters the composition of bile, making it more lithogenic.

## Clinical features

Similar to clinical features of acute pancreatitis in nonpregnant individuals

## Diagnostics

- CBC

- May show physiologic alterations due to pregnancy (e.g., leukocytosis, increased serum amylase and lipase)

- If amylase and/or lipase are > 3 times greater than normal, acute pancreatitis is likely  [48]

- Imaging: abdominal ultrasound or MRI are preferred (e.g., to identify choledocholithiasis or complications of acute pancreatitis such as hemorrhage, edema, or pseudocysts)

## Treatment

- Identical to that for nonpregnant individuals (see “Treatment of acute pancreatitis.”)

- See “Overview of analgesics to avoid during pregnancy” for further details.

## Complications

- See “Complications of acute pancreatitis.”

- Pregnancy-related complications: increased risk of preterm labor, premature birth, and/or fetal death

### Acute pancreatitis in children [49][50][51]

## Epidemiology

Incidence is 3–13 cases per 100,000 people per year. [51]

## Etiology [51]

- Biliary pancreatitis (most common cause)

- Medications (e.g., valproic acid, mesalamine, glucocorticoids)

- Systemic disease (e.g., metabolic disorders, hemolytic uremic syndrome, Kawasaki disease)

- Underlying genetic conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis)

- Anatomical anomalies of the pancreas (e.g., pancreas divisum, annular pancreas)

- Trauma and/or child maltreatment

- Infection (e.g., mumps, influenza, herpes viruses, hepatitis)

- Critical illness (e.g., sepsis)

- Autoimmune pancreatitis

Approximately 20% of children have > 1 underlying cause. [51]

## Clinical features [51]

- Similar to clinical features of acute pancreatitis in adults

- Symptoms common in infants and young children include:

- Generalized abdominal pain

- Irritability

## Diagnostics

- Similar to diagnostics for acute pancreatitis in adults [49][50]

- Use adult diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis.

- Serum lipase is more reliable than amylase in infants. [51]

- Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality. [49]

- Studies considered by a specialist (e.g., gastroenterology) may include:

- Genetic studies  [50]

- Diagnostics for cystic fibrosis

- Stool studies

## Management of pediatric pancreatitis [49][50]

- Treatment of acute pancreatitis in children is similar to adults with the following changes:

- Use pediatric parameters for fluid resuscitation (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline).  [49]

- Bolus: 10–20 mL/kg once in hemodynamically unstable patients [49]

- Maintenance rate: 1.5–2 times the typical weight-based maintenance rate for 24–48 hours [49]

- Pain management according to the WHO analgesic ladder may include both of the following:

- Nonopioid oral analgesia in children (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs)

- Opioids for acute pain

- Consult a specialist (e.g., gastroenterology, surgery) for:

- Clinical deterioration

- Suspected complications

- Consideration of invasive procedure

- Recurrent acute pancreatitis

Up to 40% of children with acute pancreatitis eventually progress to chronic pancreatitis. [51]

| Possible consequences of pancreatitis Capillary leakage → hypotension, tachycardia → distributive shock Pancreatic necrosis Hypocalcemia: lipase breaks down peripancreatic and mesenteric fat → release of free fatty acids that bind calcium → hypocalcemia (fatty saponification) | Fibrosis: exposure to toxins and/or inflammatory mediators (e.g., alcohol, cytokines) → activation of pancreatic stellate cells |
| Course | Sudden onset | Recurrent, progressive episodes |
| Clinical features | Main symptoms | Constant, severe epigastric pain (classically radiating towards the back) Nausea, vomiting Fever Weakness | Epigastric abdominal pain (main symptom) Radiating towards the back Relieves on bending forward, exacerbates after eating Cramping abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, flatulence Nausea |
| Further symptoms | Signs of shock: tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria/anuria Abdominal tenderness, distention Cullen sign  Grey Turner sign  Fox sign Pleural effusion and/or ARDS | Steatorrhea (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency): can lead to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins Malabsorption and weight loss Pancreatic diabetes (endocrine pancreatic insufficiency) Usually manifest late, when > 90% of the pancreatic parenchyma is destroyed |
| Diagnostics | Laboratory studies | ↑ Lipase (specific) ↑ Amylase (nonspecific) ↓ Calcium Hct (to assess severity) | Lipase and amylase (often normal) ↓ Fecal elastase-1 (confirms that steatorrhea is due to pancreatic lipase insufficiency) |
| Imaging | Ultrasound Pancreatic edema Peripancreatic fluid Hemorrhage, necrosis, abscesses, pancreatic pseudocysts In biliary pancreatitis: evidence of cholelithiasis or biliary sludge CT scan  Enlargement of the pancreatic parenchyma with edema Indistinct pancreatic margins with surrounding fat stranding X-ray Sentinel loop sign  Colon cut off sign MRCP/ERCP (in case of biliary or pancreatic duct obstruction) | Abdominal CT (best initial imaging modality) Ductal dilations, stenosis, and calcifications (more sensitive than x-ray)  Chain-of-lakes appearance of the main pancreatic duct Pancreatic atrophy ERCP Ductal stones (visible as filling defects) Chain-of-lakes or string-of-pearls appearance Abdominal ultrasound Pancreatic edema Pancreatic calcifications |
| Treatment | Analgesics: NSAIDs, opioids (e.g., hydromorphone) for severe pain |
| General measures Discontinuation of aggravating agents Fluid resuscitation: moderate hydration with crystalloids Enteral feeding (oral/nasogastric/nasojejunal) O2 administration Antibiotics: only in patients with evidence of infected necrosis Procedures: ERCP/cholecystectomy may be considered for biliary pancreatitis | General measures Avoidance of aggravating substances (e.g., alcohol, nicotine) Pancreatic enzyme replacement (with meals) Further pain management Celiac ganglion block Endoscopic papillotomy with ductal dilation, stent placement, and removal of stones Surgery (for suspected pancreatic cancer or intractable pain) |
| Complications | Localized Bacterial superinfection of necrotic tissue Pancreatic pseudocysts  Pancreatic abscess  Fistula formation Organ dysfunction (e.g., acute lung injury/ARDS, renal failure, shock) Hypocalcemia (due to saponification) Blood vessel erosion with bleeding Splenic vein thrombosis Systemic SIRS, sepsis, DIC Pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS Shock Prerenal failure due to volume depletion Hypocalcemia Pleural effusion | Chronic pain Opiate addiction Pancreatic insufficiency Exocrine insufficiency: maldigestion, steatorrhea, malabsorption Endocrine insufficiency: pancreatic diabetes Pancreatic pseudocysts Splenic vein thrombosis Pancreatic abscess Portal vein thrombosis Pancreatic cancer |
| Prognosis | Mortality In patients without organ failure: < 1% In patients with organ failure: ∼ 30% [8] | Dependent on alcohol use, smoking, and presence of end-stage liver disease [52] |

### Complications

### Necrotizing pancreatitis [15]

- Definition: necrosis of pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue

- Clinical features: fever, persistent tachycardia, or insufficient symptomatic improvement over several days

- Diagnostics: nonenhancing areas of pancreatic parenchyma on CECT abdomen  [9]

- Treatment [15]

- Sterile necrotizing pancreatitis can usually be managed conservatively. [7]

- Encourage enteral nutrition if feasible.

- Provide supplemental nutritional support as needed.

Pancreatic necrosis

### Infected necrotizing pancreatitis [15]

- Definition: bacterial superinfection of necrotic pancreatic parenchyma

- Clinical features: similar to those of necrotizing pancreatitis

- Diagnostics

- Laboratory studies: persistent or worsening leukocytosis, bacteremia, increasing inflammatory markers [15]

- CECT abdomen: gas within the pancreas and/or peripancreatic tissue or fluid collections [6]

- Fine-needle aspiration of necrotic areas: not routinely recommended  [4][7][11]

- Treatment [15]

- Supportive care: fluid therapy, analgesics, nutritional support

- Broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics with good tissue penetration (e.g., carbapenems DOSAGE , quinolones, third- or higher-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole) for 2–4 weeks [4][15]

- Drainage of infected material if there is clinical deterioration or persistence of symptoms despite antibiotic therapy

- Operative pancreatic debridement (necrosectomy) should ideally be performed at least 2–4 weeks after initial presentation.  [4][15]

- Minimally invasive procedures (e.g., image-guided percutaneous drainage) can be performed in the first 2 weeks in seriously ill patients.

- Prognosis: high mortality rate (30%) [15]

### Walled-off necrosis

- Definition

- An encapsulated collection of sterile necrotic material, usually occurring > 4 weeks after the onset of necrotizing pancreatitis [6]

- Previously known as pancreatic abscess

- Diagnostics: CT abdomen with IV contrast showing an encapsulated heterogeneous collection containing fluid and debris [9]

- Treatment:  (of symptomatic walled-off necrosis): percutaneous drainage or transmural endoscopic necrosectomy [15]

Walled-off necrosis (pancreatic abscess)

### Other localized complications [53][54]

- Pancreatic pseudocyst

- Abdominal compartment syndrome

- Splenic vein thrombosis

- Pancreatic hemorrhage (blood vessel erosion with bleeding)

Pancreatic pseudocyst

### Systemic complications [55]

- Shock, SIRS, sepsis, DIC

- Pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS  [55]

- Pleural effusion

- Prerenal failure due to volume depletion

- Hypocalcemia

- Paralytic ileus

- Pancreatic ascites

We list the most important complications. The selection is not exhaustive.CollapseNotesFeedback
### Prognosis

- Mortality

- In patients without organ failure: < 1%

- In patients with organ failure: ∼ 30%

- Higher mortality in patients with biliary pancreatitis than in patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis

- Risk factors for severe disease: See “Severity scores for acute pancreatitis.”  [4][56]
