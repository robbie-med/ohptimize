99. SKIN BIOPSIES
INDICATIONS
Lesions suspected of being malignant or pre-malignant (i.e., actinic keratosis)
A persistent rash, unresponsive to treatment
Lesions that are difficultto diagnose by clinical exam
Bullous disorders: Send for immunofluorescence
Congenital nevi: Increased incidence of developing into melanoma
Cosmetic purposes
INFORMED CONSENT: Patient should understand risk of scarring, bleeding, the
indications and alternatives, general risks and that further treatment may be necessary
SITE
Choose well-developed lesions
If a lesion is ulcerated, then biopsy the border
Lesions to avoid (consider referral)
Cosmetically sensitive areas
Face
Hypertrophic scarring areas like upper chest and deltoid region
Excoriated lesions
Secondarily infected areas
High-infection areas: Axilla and groin
Lesions overlying vital structures (nerves, arteries, joints)
Suspicion of vascular lesions (due to bleeding risk)
ANESTHESIA
1% Lidocaine (Xylocaine) is usually adequate. Use enough to make a good wheal under
the skin
Lidocaine with Epinephrine: Useful if hemostasis is an issue or prolonged effect desired.
Do not use on fingers, toes, nose, clitoris or penis
Adjuncts
Topical anesthetics, i.e., EMLA cream (2.5% Lidocaine, 2.5% Prilocaine): Applied
thickly over area with occlusion for at least an hour. Not to be used on mucous
membranes or broken skin
Cryotherapy
TYPES: Take care with handling so as not to crush sample, place immediately in formalin.
Special studies such as immunofluorescence and electron microscopy require special handling
and stains
Shave biopsy: If the blade is kept parallel to the skin, scarring should be slight
Indications: Removal of protruding portion of superficial raised papular or
pedunculated lesions or superficial lesions on a convex surface (pinnae of the ear or
nose) when full thickness specimens are not required (e.g., milia, warts, seborrheic
keratosis, molluscum contagiosum, benign appearing nevi)
Should NOT be the technique of choice for any lesion suspicious for melanoma (need
full thickness specimen for Breslow or Clark staging)
Technique
Infuse local anesthetic intradermally to raise lesion

DERM
Stretch skin on either side of the biopsy site
Use a No. 15 scalpel or a No. 10 scalpel for larger lesions
Keep blade parallel to skin with cutting edge upward to prevent penetration into
dermis
Hemostasis (See below)
Punch biopsy: Full thickness cylindric biopsies, 2–8mm in size
Indications: When full thickness specimen is required (e.g., sarcoidosis, granuloma
annulare, sclerosing basal cell CA, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, connective tissue
disorders, bullous skin diseases). Easy removal of small tumors or when multiple
biopsies are needed. If suspicious of malignant melanoma, perform an excisional
biopsy
Technique
Determine the proper size instrument required to adequately obtain clear skin
margins (will help to avoid repeat excision for atypical or dysplastic lesions)
Stretching skin perpendicular to tension lines while performing biopsy will result
in oval shaped skin defect which can more easily be closed with sutures
While rotating the instrument in an alternating clockwise/counterclockwise
fashion, apply perpendicular pressure until the subcutaneous tissue is reached
Lift specimen with toothless Adson forceps (or 25 gauge needle) and cut the base
Close biopsy sites > 4mm (e.g., 4–0 or 5–0 Ethilon). If site is not sutured, then
inform patient that there will be a scar—usually a 1–2mm white depression at the
site
Sutures should be removed in 5 days if on face, 7 days on upper extremity, and
10–14 days on lower extremity
Excisional biopsy: Removal of the entire area of pathology
Indications: Removal of tumors of the skin for diagnosis and cure
Technique
Elliptical excision oriented parallel to the skin tension lines (Langer’s lines)
Length is 3 times the width
If suspicious of melanoma, then refer to physician experienced in skin cancer
Undermining the wound may allow for easier closure (blunt dissection under
wound edges to create a plane under the skin to allow the wound edges to be more
easily brought together with minimum tension)
Consider layered closure for large defects (absorbable suture such as Vicryl for
deep and nylon or polypropylene sutures (4–0 to 5–0) for the skin edges)
Hemostasis (See below)
Incision biopsy: Elliptical specimen taken from within a lesion
Indications: For examination of subcutaneous tissues (fibrous tumors, panniculitis)
and when necessary to view transition from normal to abnormal tissue. In pigmented
lesions, use only if there are contraindications to excisional biopsy (cosmesis or
functional considerations)
Technique: Similar to excisional biopsy
Narrow elliptical incision
Choose location of most raised or most pigmented area of the lesion
Technique as above
Hemostasis (See below)
HEMOSTASIS
Pressure
Pinpoint electrodesiccation
Topical solutions
Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate (Drysol)
Absorbable gelatin powder (Gelfoam)
30% Aluminum Chloride
Monsel’s solution (Ferric Subsulfate): May leave raised pigmented lesion
Silver Nitrate

CLINICAL PEARLS
Because of possibility of malignant transformation of congenital nevi, it is recommended
that all congenital nevi be considered for prophylactic excision
Never use a shave biopsy for pigmented lesions
Allergy to Procaine (Novocain) is not a contraindication to use of Lidocaine
The incidence of melanoma has nearly tripled in the last 3 decades, faster than any
other cancer. The poor prognosis makes speed and accuracy of diagnosis essential. The
ABCDE’s of malignant melanoma are
A—asymmetry
B—border irregularity
C—color variegation
D—diameter > 6mm
E—enlargement, rapid growth over weeks to months
