73. HEMORRHOIDS
DEFINITION: Hemorrhoids (piles) are varicosities of the rectal venous plexus. Can occur
internally (above the pectinate line) or externally (below the pectinate line)
Internal hemorrhoids are covered by viscerally innervated mucosa. Uncomplicated
internal hemorrhoids are not painful. Internal hemorrhoids are referred to as complicated
when the patient presents with painless bleeding, prolapse or thrombosis. Internal
hemorrhoids may occasionally become strangulated (massive prolapse and thrombosis,
necrosis and ulceration) and the patient presents with severe pain and inability to sit down
or defecate
External hemorrhoids are covered by somatic innervated mucosa. May be painful or
painless. Complications include acute thrombosis or rupture with hematoma formation
CLASSIFICATION OF INTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS
Grade 1: Do not protrude, cannot be palpated by digital rectal exam (DRE), require
anoscopy for diagnosis
Grade 2: Protrude, reduce spontaneously
Grade 3: Protrude, require manual reduction
Grade 4: Prolapsed, irreducible
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
History
Rectal itching (from stool residue left secondary to poor wiping because of pain)
Straining with stool
Lump at the rectum
History of constipation
Rectal bleeding
Pain: May be caused by fissure, thrombosis, ulceration or infection
Physical exam
Inspect the rectum for external hemorrhoids or prolapsed internal hemorrhoids with the
patient at rest and while straining. Hemorrhoids are usually painless, red or purplish,
and protruding from the anus
Examine for fissures, dermatitis, fungal infection and herpes. May use cotton swab to
gently separate the edges of the anus to look for fissures
Digital rectal examination (DRE): Detects only thrombosed internal hemorrhoids, but
may detect anal cancer/masses which may be confused with hemorrhoids
EVALUATION
Anoscopy: May be performed routinely or if diagnosis is in question
Gently insert a lubricated anoscope
Ask the patient to “bear down” (not too forcefully)
Slowly withdraw the anoscope
Watch for internal hemorrhoids to bulge into the anorectal lumen
Full evaluation of the colon: Consider evaluation with colonoscopy or flexible
sigmoidoscopy and air contrast barium enema to exclude other sources of GI bleeding
including colon cancer, neoplastic polyps, AV malformation, and inflammatory bowel
disease, especially if older than 40 and/or family history of colon cancer

MANAGEMENT
Initial management: Conservative management is recommended for grade 1–3
hemorrhoids. If these conservative measures are unsuccessful, then consider definitive
management
Lifestyle changes to avoid constipation (See Chapter 72, Constipation in Adults)
Defecation: Patients should not suppress the urge to defecate and should not strain
while defecating
Diet: Modify diet to increase intake of fiber, fluids, and fruit juices. Decrease fats
and meats
Exercise: Increase aerobic exercise
Sitz bath: Sitting in a warm or cool tub for 20 minutes BID–TID commonly
recommended, but show no benefit
Anusol-HC cream or suppositories (Hydrocortisone Acetate) are commonly
recommended; however, no randomized studies support use
Definitive management: Patients with acute thrombosis and prolapse of internal
hemorrhoids may require hospitalization and treatment with bed rest, analgesics, stool
softeners and often hemorrhoidectomy. Definitive therapy is indicated for grade 4
hemorrhoids and grade 1–3 hemorrhoids which are not amenable to the above measures
Ligation: Cure rates about 80–90%. The hemorrhoid is strangulated by placing a
rubber band at the base. Complications include pain (6%), bleeding (3%), and perianal
hematoma (3%). May require 2–3 separate ligations. Fatal septicemia has been
reported after ligation and may present with triad of perianal pain, fever and urinary
hesitancy
Infrared coagulation: Success rates are lower than ligation and involves applying the
tip of a tungsten-halogen lamp to the base of the hemorrhoid
Excision and evacuation: Indicated for large painful thrombosed external hemorrhoids
(small thrombosed external hemorrhoids may respond to conservative management)
Patient is placed in fetal position or on knees with buttocks taped open (the tape
pulls one buttock laterally and then goes around abdomen and then placed so that
it pulls the other buttock laterally)
Hemorrhoid is anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine with Epinephrine. Use Lidocaine
around the edges of hemorrhoid
An elliptical incision is made over lateral edges of hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoid and
clot are removed
Sutures are not necessary. Wound is left open to heal by secondary intention

CLINICAL PEARLS
Simple incision has higher recurrence rate compared to using an elliptical incision to

completely excise clotted hemorrhoid
About ½ of Americans over 50 will seek medical advice for hemorrhoids
Most common cause of painless rectal bleeding is internal hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are unusual in children and should be viewed with eye toward other disease
Rectal pruritus may be initial complaint with hemorrhoids, but consider other causes
such as fissures, dermatitis (contact or seborrheic), psoriasis, pinworm, Candida, herpes,
neurodermatitis, and squamous cell cancer
