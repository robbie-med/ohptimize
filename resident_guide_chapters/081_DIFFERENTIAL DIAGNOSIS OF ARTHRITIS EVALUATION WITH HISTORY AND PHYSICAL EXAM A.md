81. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ARTHRITIS
EVALUATION WITH HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
Aim of initial evaluation to distinguish between true articular pain and periarticular
problem; use to guide formation of differential diagnosis and treatment plan
History should include the following
Description of symptoms including chronicity and new/recurrence
Number and symmetry of involved joints
Trauma, fractures
Past medical history (comorbid conditions) and past surgical history
Medications
Exposures (travel, insect bites, STI)
Systemic symptoms
Assessment of ADLs
Physical exam should include the following
Signs of trauma
Warmth and erythema
Active and passive range of motion
Absence or presence of joint effusion
Absence or presence of crepitation
Signs of organ system involvement (fever, lungs, eye, gastrointestinal system, heart,
kidney)
TYPES OF ARTHRITIS
Noninflammatory (AKA mechanical) arthritis
Mechanical (internal derangement, fracture, trauma, or loose body) is suggested by
rapid onset of pain (over seconds or minutes), pain that occurs only after use and
improves with rest, involves weight-bearing joints, and morning stiffness lasting < 1
hour
Swelling, tenderness to palpation, and crepitation on exam
Inflammatory arthritis
Inflammatory arthritis is suggested by onset from hours to days, intermittent pain
unrelated to patterns of use, fluctuations of pain and swelling, and morning stiffness
lasting > 1 hour
Erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness to palpation on exam
May have signs of systemic inflammation
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: MONOARTICULAR VS. POLYARTICULAR
ARTHRITIS
Monoarticular
Infectious arthritis: Bacterial, tuberculous, fungal, Lyme disease, viral
Most develop from hematogenous spread
Most common organisms are gram-positive aerobes
May have known systemic risk factors such as corticosteroid therapy,
immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, diabetes, or intravenous drug abuse and
local pathology such as effusions, penetrating trauma, prosthetic joint
Symptoms include intense local pain, swelling, warmth, erythema, and markedly
restricted range of motion
Joint sepsis produces dramatic inflammation followed quickly by irreversible
destruction of cartilage and bone

Gonococcal infection tends to manifest as an exquisitely painful monarthritis or
polyarthritis and often is preceded by a migratory arthritis
Lyme arthritis occurs weeks to months after initial exposure, well after initial
symptoms of fevers, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and rash
Arthrocentesis should absolutely be performed in all patients with monoarticular
arthritis where infectious arthritis is suspected
Crystal-induced arthritis: Gout, pseudogout, calcium oxalate, liquid lipid
microspherules
History often includes recurrent, self-limited attacks of inflammation of the same
joint
Clinical features include extremely rapid onset of severe pain and inflammation
with extension of the inflammatory process into surrounding tissues, producing
appearance of cellulitis
Gout typically involves the MTP joint, ankle, midfoot or knee initially
Gout is present when urate crystals are identified in synovial fluid or confirmed by
documentation of urate crystals in a tophus
Mechanical: Internal derangement, trauma overuse, loose body, osteochondritis
dissecans, stress fracture
Systemic diseases: Psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
lupus erythematosus
Ischemic necrosis
Hemarthrosis
May occur in patients with clotting disorders or on anticoagulant therapy
Pauciarticular juvenile: Rheumatoid arthritis
Neoplastic: Osteogenic sarcoma, metastatic tumor
Other: Congenital hip dysplasia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, Paget’s disease
involving joint, osteomyelitis
Hip symptoms in a young patient suggest congenital dysplasia of hip or slipped
capital femoral epiphysis
Osteochondritis dissecans should be suspected in a child or teenager who, after
minor trauma, has relatively severe knee pain followed by mechanical dysfunction
Osteonecrosis is a common cause of monoarthritis of the hip, shoulders, and knees
in young people with systemic diseases who require corticosteroid therapy
Polyarticular
Infectious arthritis: Viral, rubella, gonococcal, meningococcal, Lyme disease, fungal,
mycobacterial
Postinfectious or reactive arthritis: Rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal arthritis,
reactive arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Osteoarthritis
Psoriatic arthritis
Systemic rheumatic disease: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome,
systemic sclerosis, poly/dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, Still’s
disease, polymyalgia rheumatica
Reiter’s syndrome: Idiopathic and human immunodeficiency virus
Crystal-induced: Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, gout, pseudogout
Chronic articular hemorrhage
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile spondylitis
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
Myxedematous arthropathy
Erythema nodosum/sarcoid
Henoch-Schönlein purpura
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
Imaging
371
MUSC
X-rays: Plain radiographs of the affected joints should be obtained especially if trauma
history; common findings are soft tissue calcification, osteoarthritis, chondrocalcinosis,
loose bodies, fracture, malignancy, osteomyelitis, or Paget’s disease
Nuclear Medicine: Useful when it is important to search for a site of infection that
cannot be detected or localized, fibrocartilaginous joints in which range of motion is
poorly tested, or the spine
MRI: Superior to other imaging modalities in the diagnosis of ischemic necrosis of
bone; occult fractures, meniscal and cruciate ligament injuries
Ultrasound: Useful for aspirating almost any joint
Laboratory tests for polyarthritis: See VI. Table below
Synovial fluid analysis: To differentiate between inflammatory, non-inflammatory and
septic arthritis in patients with monoarthritis. See V. Table below
Cultures: Culture synovial fluid if septic arthritis is suspected. If gonococcal arthritis
is a consideration, cervical urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal samples should be obtained
as well
Synovial biopsy: May play a role in the diagnosis of chronic, unexplained monoarticular
arthritis; tuberculous or fungal synovitis is more frequently identified by staining and
culture of open biopsy material than by similar studies of synovial fluid

1Gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions occasionally have synovial fluid WBC counts >
75,000/mcL but rarely > 100,000/mcL.
2Most purulent effusions are due to septic arthritis. Septic arthritis, however, can present with group II synovial
fluid, particularly if infection is caused by organisms of low virulence (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae) or if antibiotic
therapy has been started.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Rapid development of arthritis symptoms—consider the possibility of fracture, an adjacent
destructive process such as metastatic tumor, or avascular necrosis
Untreated infectious arthritis can destroy a joint in 1–2 days; arthrocentesis should be
performed to investigate the possibility of infection in patient with severe monoarticular
arthritis where an infectious cause is suspected
Intravenous drug abuse increases the risk of septic arthritis through the introduction of
infectious material into the intravascular space with subsequent hematogenous spread to
the joints; most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
American College of Rheumatology Choosing Wisely recommendations
◦Don’t test ANA sub-serologies without a positive ANA and clinical suspicion of
immune-mediated disease
◦Don’t test for Lyme disease as a cause of musculoskeletal symptoms without an
exposure history and appropriate physical exam findings
