95. OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE
INTRODUCTION: Occupational medicine is a multi-faceted discipline which includes the
evaluation and management of industrial injuries, pre-employment physical exams, commercial
motor vehicle driver examinations, pilot/air traffic controller medical certificate examinations,
determinations of fitness to return to work, disability evaluation and employee wellness. Many
specifics of the legal aspects of the management of occupational injuries are variable dependent
upon the specific State in which the care is provided
TERMINOLOGY
Additional allowance: A condition not originally recognized in the claim which is
requested to be added to the claim as an allowed condition
Allowed condition: This is a medical condition that is recognized within an industrial
claim as being related to the original injury either directly or indirectly. Only allowed
conditions in a claim may be treated through the industrial claim
Causation: The relationship of a presenting condition to an alleged industrial injury
Cumulative trauma: a condition arising out of repeated exposure to a moderate or high-
risk occupational situation
Disallowed condition: A condition that has been requested to be part of an industrial claim
which is determined to not be reasonably related to the injury either directly or indirectly.
Disallowed conditions cannot be treated through an industrial claim
Flow-through condition: A condition that did not occur at the time of the original injury
but has been determined to be reasonably related to the conditions allowed in the claim.
For example, a patient who underwent a shoulder surgery and subsequently developed
cellulitis at the incision site
Independent Medical Evaluation (IME): Evaluation requested when there is a
disagreement with the allowance of a claim, a condition, or a requested service in an
industrial claim. The independent medical examiner is a physician who provides an expert
opinion on the appropriateness of a claim. The IME physician does not establish a doctor-
patient relationship with the injured worker and does not provide medical care for the
injury
Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI): This refers to the point where a specific
condition has had all reasonably appropriate and necessary treatment that the injured
worker is agreeable to, and no further improvement can be expected. MMI does not
mean that the injured worker cannot receive ongoing maintenance care, but it can affect
compensation if they are unable to continue to work
Physician of record: This term refers to the primary physician who is managing the
injured worker’s care. The injured worker can only have one physician of record, although
they can be referred to other specialists, as necessary. Whether the patient can choose their
physician of record is dependent upon the state regulations
Statute of limitations: The amount of time that a claim can still be filed after the original
injury or that a claim can remain open without ongoing activity. This varies from state to
state
Substantial aggravation: A condition that pre-existed an industrial injury is objectively
demonstrated to be worsened by the injury
Unallowed/unrecognized condition: These terms refer to conditions that have not been
requested to be part of an industrial claim. These conditions cannot be treated through the
claim without being approved as additional allowances

INITIAL EVALUATION OF ALLEGED WORK-RELATED INJURIES
General: Occupational medicine is different from traditional primary care, in that the only
conditions that can be addressed in the visit are those related to the industrial injury. The
initial evaluation of an industrial injury is extremely important, as it is the best opportunity
to obtain the details necessary for determination of causation. When opening a new claim
for a patient presenting for the first evaluation of an alleged occupational injury, the
provider will be asked for an opinion regarding whether or not the presenting conditions
are related to the injury as described by the injured worker
History
Description of the injury: This should include specifics about posture, body part
position, weight/force (when applicable), amount of time engaged in the activity
described, length of employment, and any extraneous factors that may have
contributed to the injury (e.g., a broken/malfunctioning piece of equipment)
Past medical history: History of prior injuries to the same body part(s), prior surgeries
or potentially confounding medical conditions (pre-existing osteoarthritis, etc.)
Course: therapies tried for injury or other settings injury has been evaluated (urgent
care, emergency department)
Physical exam
If musculoskeletal, include inspection, palpation, range of motion testing, strength
testing, sensory testing and special testing when appropriate
Evaluation of the joint above and below the injured joint
Document specific parameters (e.g., range of motion and grip strength) to monitor over
time
INJURY MANAGEMENT
General: Only conditions related to the original injury and allowed in the industrial claim
may be treated. This requires the establishment of causality as related to the injury as either
work-related or non-work-related
Establishing causation: Often the most challenging part of the treatment. The treating
physician must gather and synthesize information, physical exam findings and diagnostics
to determine whether or not the presenting condition is or is not likely related to the
alleged injury
Opening a claim: Once causation has been determined, the physician of record will
help the injured worker open a claim. The process of doing this varies from state to state.
Most forms ask for an expert opinion from the treating physician as to whether or not the
conditions being treated are or are not related to the injury
Initial management: Workers compensation is driven by protocols and evidence-based
injury management guidelines. Several well-established resources are available to assist
with determining the appropriate course of treatment, including the Official Disability
Guidelines (ODG) from the Work Loss Data Institute. Following these guidelines makes
it more likely that any services being requested will be approved. All services necessary
for treatment of the injury generally need to be approved by the workers’ compensation
authority or a third-party administrator before they can be scheduled
Designation of Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI): After all therapies have
been attempted and there is no further expectation of improvement, the injured worker is
designated to have reached a point of maximum medical improvement
Closing a claim: A claim may close after a period of inactivity, and will eventually
become a “dead claim,” which is a legal determination that may vary from state to state

Alcoholism
Vision impairment (worse than 20/40)
Maximum clearance is 2 years—may be a shorter period if hypertension is uncontrolled,
etc.
Medical providers are required to complete a medical examiner training program
PILOT/AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER MEDICAL CERTIFICATE
EXAMINATIONS
Regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a division of the Department of
Transportation
First-, Second-, and Third-Class medical certificates depending on the need of the pilot/
controller

passengers)
Second-Class medical certificate: Commercial Pilots (no passengers), Air Traffic
Controllers
Third-Class medical certificate: Private or recreational pilots
Strict exclusions for medication history, physical exam, and medications
Class of medical certificate determines maximum length of validity of certificate
Medical providers are required to complete the Air Medical Examiner training program
offered by the FAA
