56. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
(COPD)
GENERAL
COPD classically encompasses several diffuse pulmonary diseases including chronic
asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and emphysema. This section
focuses on chronic bronchitis and emphysema
Definitions
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as the progressive devel-
opment of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (American Thoracic Society).
Most patients will have components of chronic bronchitis and emphysema
Chronic bronchitis: A recurrent and productive cough on most days for 3 months or
more in 2 consecutive years without another explanation. Caused by obstruction of
small airways
Emphysema: The destruction of interalveolar septa characterized as having abnormal,
permanent enlargement or air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole without obvious
fibrosis. Caused by enlargement of air spaces and destruction of lung parenchyma, loss
of lung elasticity, and closure of small airways
COPD affects 30 million Americans and is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S.
Airway obstruction is present in 14% of white, male smokers compared to 3% of non-
smokers
Classification of severity of airflow limitation in COPD (based on post-bronchodilator
FEV1)
GOLD 1: Mild—FEV1 ≥80% predicted
GOLD 2: Moderate—50% ≤FEV1 < 80% predicted
GOLD 3: Severe—30% ≤FEV1 < 50% predicted
GOLD 4: Very Severe—FEV1 < 30% predicted

HISTORY
Inquire about fever, cough, dyspnea, exercise tolerance (current and baseline), chest pain,
peripheral edema, history of environmental exposures, and cigarette smoking
PHYSICAL EXAM
Increased A-P diameter, decreased lung sounds, prolonged expiration, dyspnea at rest,
wheezing, pursed lip breathing, periorbital cyanosis, use of accessory muscles to breathe,
rales and rhonchi, pedal edema, ascites, pink puffer (emphysema) vs. blue bloater (chronic
bronchitis)
COPD EXACERBATING FACTORS (in order of frequency)
BIRCHES—Bronchospasm, Infection (respiratory), Retained secretions, CHF,
Hypoventilation (medications, neuromuscular), Emboli, Systemic illness (fever, MI, non-
pulmonary infection)
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
Chest x-ray: In later stages may show flattening of the diaphragms, increased lung
volumes, bullae and blebs, small heart (secondary to vertical orientation), increased
retrosternal clear space. May see increased bronchovascular markings with chronic
bronchitis
Laboratory
ABG: Useful for patients suspected of having moderate to severe lung disease
α-1 antitrypsin levels: Obtain if patient presents with emphysema at < age 50, if there
is a family history of early onset emphysema, or if < 20 pack/year smoking history
Pulmonary function testing: Perform spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator and/or
DLCO and lung volumes in selected patients. The presence of a post-bronchodilator
FEV1/FVC confirms the presence of persistent airflow limitation and thus of COPD

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Acute bronchitis, acute viral infection, asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchogenic carcinoma,
chronic pulmonary embolism, sleep apnea, primary alveolar hypoventilation, and chronic
sinusitis
MANAGEMENT OF COPD
Smoking cessation
Bronchodilators
Central to the symptomatic management of COPD
Inhaled therapy is preferred
Can be given “as needed” for acute symptom relief and on a regular basis to prevent
or reduce persistent symptoms
Three groups of bronchodilators
Anticholinergics (Inhaled)
Short-acting antimuscarinic antagonist (SAMA): Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)
has an onset of action 15 minutes and a duration of action up to 6 hours. It has
limited systemic absorption
Long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMAs): Tiotropium (Spiriva
HandiHaler), aclidinium (Tudorza Pressair), glycopyrronium (Seebri
Neohaler), and umeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta) have a long duration of action
that allows once-daily dosing. Results of some studies have suggested that it is
more effective than a long-acting β-agonist
β -agonists (Inhaled)
Short-acting β-agonists (SABAs) have a rapid onset (< 5 minutes) and a
duration of ≤4 hours. Commonly used β2-agonists include Albuterol (ProAir,
Ventolin, Proventil) and Levalbuterol (Xopenex)
Long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) show a duration of action of ≥12 hours
Salmeterol (Serevent) and Formoterol (Perforomist) are dosed twice daily.
Indacaterol (Arcapta) and Olodaterol (Striverdi) are once daily LABAs.
Arformoterol (Brovana) is available as a twice daily nebulizer
All of them have a black box warning about an increased risk of asthma-
related deaths; but patients with COPD are not at risk
Methylxanthines (oral)
Use slow-release Theophylline (e.g., Theo-Dur)
Has a narrow therapeutic index; monitoring is warranted to maintain a serum
level of 5–12mcg/mL
Interacts with many drugs, including Cimetidine, Ciprofloxacin, and
Erythromycin
Adjust dose in older patients and patients with cor pulmonale or CHF
The choice of bronchodilators depends on the availability of medication and each
patient’s individual response in terms of both symptom relief and side-effects
Regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators is more effective and convenient
than treatment with short-acting bronchodilators
Bronchodilators can be used alone or in combination
Combining bronchodilators with different mechanisms are more effective with lower
risk of side-effects than increasing the dose of a single bronchodilator
Corticosteroids
Use of an inhaled corticosteroid is recommended in patients with severe COPD
(FEV1< 50%) who experience frequent exacerbation while receiving ≤1 long-acting
bronchodilators
The dose-response relationships and long-term safety of inhaled corticosteroids in
COPD are not known
Treatment of inhaled steroids (especially in high doses) increases the likelihood of
pneumonia and does not reduce overall mortality
The combination of an inhaled steroid and a long-acting β2-agonist is more effective
than the individual drug alone in reducing exacerbations and improving lung function
240
GEN
Long-term treatment with oral corticosteroids is not recommended
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors: Roflumilast (Daliresp)
Action: Reduce inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic AMP.
It is not a bronchodilator
Dose: 1 oral tab 500mcg daily
Side-effects: Nausea, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sleep disturbances
and headache
Caution: Roflumilast should not be used in patients with depression. Do not use
Roflumilast with Theophylline
Roflumilast is a preferred option over Theophylline. It may be useful in advanced
stage of COPD. Potential benefits should be weighed against the potential risks prior
to initiating this drug
Antibiotics
Exacerbations may be due to bacterial, viral, or URI infections
Antibiotics have been shown to have an effect on clinical recovery and outcome in
acute infectious exacerbation of COPD
Therapy should be directed at S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.
C. pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia should also be considered. Take into
account local resistance patterns, patient history, and disease severity when selecting
an antibiotic
Typical initial outpatient therapy
Azithromycin 500mg × 1, then 250mg PO daily × 4 days
Doxycycline 100mg BID
Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) 875mg BID for complicated flare
The duration of therapy is 5–7 days
Adjunctive therapy: Mucolytic-expectorant may be used in patients with thick or viscous
sputum or difficulty with expectoration. E.g., Guaifenesin (Robitussin, Humibid LA,
Mucinex) 1–2 PO BID. The overall benefits seem to be very small
Nonpharmacologic management
Pulmonary rehabilitation: Shown to decrease hospital mortality and increase quality of
life. No change in mortality
Nocturnal ventilation with BiPAP
Lung volume reduction surgery: Most useful in patients with localized upper-lobe
emphysema. Improvements include increased FEV1, improved exercise capacity, and
improved quality of life which persist for at least 1 year
Lung transplantation
VACCINATIONS
Influenza vaccine: Annually
Pneumococcal vaccinations: PCV13 (Prevnar 13) and PPSC23 (Pneumovax 23) are
recommended for all patients ≥65 years and in younger patients who are at increased risk
for pneumococcal disease. PPSC23 is also recommended for younger COPD patients with
significant comorbidities and COPD patients < 65 years with an FEV1 < 40% predicted
INDICATIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN
Resting PaO2 < 55mmHg or O2 saturation < 88% at rest, with exercise or during sleep
pO2 55–59mmHg with concurrent cor pulmonale ≥than 16 hours/day
Goal: PaO2 60–80mmHg
PULMONARY REHABILITATION
Goals are to enhance standard medical therapy, maximize functional capacity, increase
exercise tolerance, and improve quality of life
No change in mortality
Shown to decrease hospitalizations

CLINICAL PEARLS
For patients requiring chronic oral corticosteroids, remember to monitor for osteoporosis
and diabetes
While spirometry is important for diagnosis, severity of airway obstruction does not
correlate with clinical symptoms. Assessment of clinical symptoms and exacerbations
should guide therapy
Genetic factors may determine which smokers will develop airflow limitation
