40. ENDOCARDITIS PROPHYLAXIS
The following recommendations are based on a focused 2017 update to the 2007 guidelines
from the American Heart Association—please note that there are some major changes from
previous guidelines as prophylaxis is no longer recommended for most common dental
procedures or for patients undergoing a genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedure. It is
no longer recommended for patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP)
PATIENTS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR ENDOCARDITIS PROPHYLAXIS
Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is reasonable for patients with cardiac
conditions associated with the highest risk for adverse outcome from endocarditis:
Prosthetic cardiac valve
Prosthetic material used for valve repair, such as rings and chords
Previous infective endocarditis (IE)
Cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy
Unrepaired congenital heart disease
Repaired congenital heart disease with residual shunts or valvular regurgitation or
adjacent to the site of prosthetic patch or device
Cardiac transplant with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve
Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended for patients with the
following conditions
Mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid valve disease, calcified aortic
stenosis
Congenital heart conditions such as ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Isolated secundum atrial septal defect
Patients with physiological, functional, or innocent heart murmurs, including patients
with aortic valve sclerosis as defined by focal areas of increased echogenicity and
thickening of the leaflets without restriction of motion and a peak velocity less than
2.0m per second
Patients with echocardiographic evidence of physiologic MR in the absence of a
murmur and with structurally normal valves
Patients with echocardiographic evidence of physiological tricuspid regurgitation
(TR) and/or pulmonary regurgitation in the absence of a murmur and with structurally
normal valves
Patients 6 or more months after successful surgical or percutaneous repair of atrial
septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus
PROCEDURAL INDICATIONS FOR ENDOCARDITIS PROPHYLAXIS
Procedures for which endocarditis prophylaxis is reasonable
All dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical
region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. Note: The following procedures
and events do not need prophylaxis: routine anesthetic injections through noninfected
tissue, taking dental radiographs, placement of removable prosthodontic or orthodontic
appliances, adjustment of orthodontic appliances, placement of orthodontic brackets,
shedding of deciduous teeth, and bleeding from trauma to the lips or oral mucosa
Respiratory tract procedures involving incision or biopsy of the respiratory mucosa
(e.g., tonsillectomy or bronchoscopy). Note: Studies have not demonstrated a
conclusive link and prophylaxis should be considered (class IIb recommendations)
Specific procedures for which endocarditis prophylaxis is not recommended

Bronchoscopy without biopsy
Genitourinary procedures
Gastrointestinal tract procedure (including EGD and colonoscopy)
Ear and body piercing, tattooing
Vaginal or cesarean delivery and hysterectomy
