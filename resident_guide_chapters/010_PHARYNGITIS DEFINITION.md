10. PHARYNGITIS
DEFINITION: An inflammatory process involving the mucous membranes and underlying
structures of the oropharynx
PRESENTATION
History
Chief complaint and associated symptoms (See below)
Immunization history
Sexual history (when indicated)
Signs and symptoms
Sore throat
Enlarged tonsils
Fever, chills, headache, malaise, and anorexia
Oropharyngeal erythema and/or exudate
Rash
Cervical adenopathy
Rhinitis
Symptomatic tetrad of streptococcal pharyngitis (Centor criteria)
Fever > 100.4°F (38°C)
Tender or swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes
Exudative tonsillitis
Absence of cough
Note: If all 4 are present, there is a 50% likelihood of group A β-hemolytic strep (GABHS). If
none are present, likelihood of strep is < 5%
ETIOLOGY
Bacterial: Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (causal agent in 10% of cases of adult
pharyngitis), Mycoplasma pneumoniæ, Hæmophilus influenzæ, Corynebacterium diph-
theria, Neisseria gonorrhoeæ
Viral: Adenovirus, Influenza viruses (A&B), Parainfluenza viruses, Epstein-Barr virus,
Herpes simplex virus
EVALUATION
Diagnostic testing
Not recommended for children or adults with features suggesting viral etiology
Not indicated for children < 3, due to low incidence of class streptococcal pharyngitis
and rheumatic fever
Laboratory
Rapid strep test (RSS)—up to 96% sensitive
Negative RSS in children and adolescents with typical symptoms should be further
evaluated by a throat culture (2012 IDSA Guideline)
Streptococcal throat culture: No longer recommended for adults
Decision to test adults with RSS may be based on the presence or absence of the 4
Centor criteria and risks by age (0–5 point scale)
Modified Centor Score gives additional point for age 3–14 years (highest
likelihood of GAS), and subtracts a point for age 45 or greater
If score 0–1, no testing or antibiotics needed
33
PEDS
There is a negative predictive value of 80% with the absence of 3 or 4 of the
Centor criteria. If none of the criteria are present, < 5% chance of strep
If recently exposed to strep, use clinical judgment
If score 2–3
The patient should be screened, but only treated with antibiotic if the rapid test
or culture is positive
Diagnostic tests may be deferred in patients with 4 criteria, and they may be
empirically treated with antibiotics. If 3–4 of the Centor criteria are present,
the positive predictive value of a positive test is 40–60%
If score 4–5: Consider rapid strep testing and/or culture. Empiric antibiotics may be
appropriate in some clinical scenarios
Use appropriate culture medium if other bacteria (e.g., Neisseria or Corynebacterium)
suspected
TREATMENT
Acute Group A Strep pharyngitis: The goal of initiating therapy is to decrease the chance
of secondary complications (including rheumatic fever). Therapy can safely be initiated
up to 9 days after onset of symptoms and still be effective. Note: Rheumatic fever today is
rare except in isolated outbreaks
Antibiotic of choice: Penicillin or Amoxicillin
Penicillin VK
Children—Penicillin VK: 250mg BID or TID × 10 days
Adolescents and adults—Penicillin VK: 250mg 4 ×/day or 500mg BID × 10
days
Amoxicillin oral suspension is more palatable than Penicillin
Amoxicillin: 50mg/kg once daily (max 1g) × 10 days or 25mg/kg (max
500mg) BID × 10 days
≥12 year-olds—Amoxicillin extended-release tablet (Moxatag): 775mg once
daily taken within 1 hour of finishing a meal × 10 days
Benzathine Penicillin G (Bicillin LA), long-acting Penicillin to ensure patient
adherence
< 27kg: 600,000 units IM × 1
≥27kg: 1.2 million units IM × 1
Alternatives for patients with Penicillin allergy without anaphylaxis
Cephalexin: 20mg/kg (max 500mg) BID × 10 days
Cefadroxil (Duricef): 30mg/kg once daily (max 1g) × 10 days
Alternatives for patients with significant Penicillin allergy
Azithromycin: 12mg/kg once a day (max 500mg) × 5 days
Clarithromycin: 7.5mg/kg (max 250mg) BID × 10 days
Clindamycin: 7mg/kg (max 300mg) TID × 10 days
Follow-up
Patients should have improvement in clinical symptoms within 3–4 days of initiating
antibiotic therapy
Clinical failure may be due to nonadherence or presence of β-lactamase producing
bacteria
If incomplete adherence to initial regimen is a concern, repeat treatment with IM
Benzathine Penicillin
Otherwise, retreat with an antibiotic that has greater β-lactamase stability than the
previous agent such as Amoxicillin-Clavulanate
Children: 40mg/kg/day divided TID (max 2g Amoxicillin/day) × 10 days
Adults: 500–875mg BID × 10 days
Note: Persistently positive strep testing may be due to colonization and not persistent
infection
Viral etiologies
Symptomatic relief
Gargle with warm salt water TID
34
PEDS
Chloraseptic spray or lozenges PRN for sore throat
Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen PRN for pain, fever
COMPLICATIONS
Rheumatic fever (secondary to Group A Strep)—Rare
Carditis is the most serious complication associated with acute rheumatic fever (seen
in 50 to 91% of cases of pediatric rheumatic fever and 33% of adult rheumatic fever)
Can lead to permanent valvular dysfunction
Rheumatic fever is rare in adults
Post-strep glomerulonephritis
Rare
No evidence that antibiotic treatment of pharyngitis decreases the incidence of this
complication
Peritonsillar abscess/Retropharyngeal abscess
Scarlet fever
Cervical lymphadenitis
Sinusitis/Mastoiditis
Otitis media
Meningitis
Bacteremia
Pneumonia
CLINICAL PEARLS
Streptococcal pharyngitis resolves even without antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics shorten
symptom duration by about 16 hours; the number needed to treat (NNT) for symptom
relief at 72 hours is 4
School-aged children who develop strep pharyngitis can return to school 24 hours after
therapy is initiated
Patients complaining of an associated rhinitis are more likely to have a viral etiology of
their pharyngitis
A Mono-spot test is a quick way to determine EBV (mononucleosis) infection; associated
findings may include posterior cervical adenopathy, prolonged course of symptoms, or
splenomegaly
