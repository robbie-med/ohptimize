49. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS
INTRODUCTION
Liver function tests (LFTs) typically include ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin,
and GGT. They are indirect measures of liver function. Protime/INR and albumin are a
more accurate (but still indirect) measurement of the liver’s function
Repeat testing is not necessary in the initial work-up
Ultrasound is the most useful initial radiographic study of the liver, especially for
cholestasis
HISTORY
Abdominal pain/discomfort
Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, color of stools and urine
Weight loss, fever, fatigue, anorexia, amenorrhea
Jaundice
Arthralgias (autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis), pruritus (primary sclerosing
cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis)
Medications (consider hepatotoxic agents and those metabolized by the liver)
Past medical history: History of hepatitis, COPD (α-1 antitrypsin deficiency), transfusions
Social history: Alcohol and drugs, sexual history, travel history
Family history
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Fever
Eyes: Scleral icterus or Kayser-Fleischer rings (Wilson’s disease)
Abdomen: Tenderness, enlargement of liver or spleen, ascites, palpable gall bladder
(Courvoisier’s sign)
Skin: Spider angioma or palmar erythema, jaundice and Dupuytren’s contracture
Other: Signs of hypo/hyperthyroidism, gynecomastia, fetor hepatica, asterixis
LIVER ENZYMES
Aminotransferases (ALT/AST)
Useful in diagnosing acute hepatocellular disease. There is poor correlation between
liver damage and levels of aminotransferases
ALT is present in high concentrations in the liver whereas AST is found in liver,
cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and
erythrocytes
Increases in both ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular necrosis or inflammation
Etiology
Hepatic causes of elevated aminotransferases: Alcohol-related liver injury, chronic
hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis, medications (See below), hepatic
steatosis (fatty infiltration of liver), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis,
Wilson’s disease, α-1-antitrypsin deficiency
Non-hepatic causes of elevated aminotransferases: celiac sprue, inherited and
acquired muscle diseases, exercise
In liver disease secondary to alcohol, the transaminase values rarely exceed 300U/L.
Levels that are markedly increased in an alcoholic patient suggest another etiology.
AST/ALT > 2 is suggestive of alcohol-induced liver disease
Initial evaluation
210
LABS
Obtain other LFTs if not done yet. If Alk Phos and GGT are elevated, consider
obstructive etiology
Consider medications as etiology, see V. below
Evaluate for alcohol use and if AST/ALT are minimally increased or AST:ALT >
2:1, consider trial of abstinence and recheck in 4 weeks
Testing for acute viral hepatitis including HAAb IgG, HAAb IgM, HBsAb,
HBsAg, HBc IgG, HBc IgM, and possibly HC Ab or HC PCR. Viral hepatitis may
show an increase in ALT and AST about 1 week preceding the onset of jaundice
Consider other tests including
Ferritin and possibly iron saturation (hemochromatosis)
Serum ceruloplasmin (decreased levels in Wilson’s disease)
Serum protein electrophoresis (autoimmune hepatitis, α-1 antitrypsin
deficiency)
Serum antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies (celiac sprue)
Creatine kinase and aldolase (disorders of striated muscle)
Ultrasound evaluation for obstructive picture of hepatic steatosis or nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
If etiologies are not evident after history, physical, and further testing, consider
liver biopsy
If aminotransferases are elevated but less than 2 × upper limit of normal, then
observation alone may be sufficient (as opposed to liver biopsy)
Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos)
Elevation usually indicates cholestatic liver disease (defined as intra- or extrahepatic
biliary obstruction)
Primarily found in liver, bone, intestines, kidney, WBCs, and placenta
Hepatic causes of elevated Alk Phos include
Cholestatic diseases or conditions include partial obstruction of bile ducts—
primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, adult bile ductopenia, and
cholestasis induced by the use of drugs such as anabolic steroids
Infiltrative diseases include sarcoidosis, other types of granulomatous diseases,
and less often, unsuspected metastasis of cancer to the liver
Normally elevated in 3rd trimester of pregnancy
Initial evaluation
If the Alk Phos is elevated, order a GGT to help differentiate liver vs. bone. If the
GGT is normal, the elevation is most likely due to non-hepatic causes
Initial tests include RUQ ultrasound (to assess for obstruction and to assess
hepatic parenchyma) and antimitochondrial antibodies (to assess for primary
biliary cirrhosis)
If above tests are negative and Alk Phos is < 50% of upper limit of normal, may
observe and follow
If above tests are negative and Alk Phos is > 50% of upper limit of normal,
consider liver biopsy and either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)
Elevated often seen in cholestatic liver disease (along with concurrent increased Alk
Phos). Test is sensitive for liver disease or alcohol use, but not specific
Found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells
Elevated in pancreatic disease, myocardial infarction, renal failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diabetes, alcoholism, and with drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin),
and barbiturates
A GGT level which is disproportionately higher than the AST, ALT, or Alk Phos in a
patient not taking Dilantin or barbiturates is likely secondary to alcohol
GGT may be increased in thyrotoxicosis, renal failure, status post myocardial
infarction, pancreatitis, diabetes, and prostate CA
Bilirubin
211
LABS
Bilirubin is an end-product of destruction of red blood cells. Unconjugated bilirubin
is bound to albumin in serum. When it gets to the liver, it is conjugated, becomes
water-soluble, and is excreted in the bile. Bilirubin may be elevated from increased
production, decreased uptake by the liver, decreased conjugation, decreased secretion
from the liver, or blockage of the bile ducts
Direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia is almost always due to hepatobiliary disease,
whereas indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia has many causes
Etiology
Elevated indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia
Increased bilirubin production: Hemolytic anemias, hemolytic reactions,
hematoma, pulmonary infarction
Impaired bilirubin uptake and storage: Post-hepatitis hyperbilirubinemia,
Gilbert’s disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, drug reactions
Elevated direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia
Hereditary cholestatic syndromes: Faulty excretion of bilirubin conjugates
such as Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor’s syndrome
Hepatocellular dysfunction: Biliary epithelial damage (hepatitis, hepatic
cirrhosis), intrahepatic cholestasis (drugs, biliary cirrhosis, sepsis,
postoperative jaundice), miscellaneous (spirochetal infections, mononucleosis,
cholangitis, sarcoidosis, lymphomas, toxins)
Biliary obstruction: Choledocholithiasis, biliary atresia, carcinoma of bile
duct, sclerosing cholangitis, pancreatitis, and pancreatic neoplasms
Evaluation: Assess whether bilirubin elevation is direct or indirect and whether other
LFTs are elevated. Determine if elevation is secondary to hepatocellular cause vs.
obstructive vs. benign cause (Gilbert’s disease or recurrent jaundice of pregnancy)
Gilbert’s disease: Benign, asymptomatic elevation of indirect bilirubin. Bilirubin level
is usually < 3mg/dL. Patients with Gilbert’s disease have no evidence of hemolysis and
other LFTs are normal. May be present in 7–10% of the population
Albumin
Is synthesized in liver and excreted in blood. Good indicator (in addition to Protime)
of the liver’s ability to function properly and make protein
Is decreased with cirrhosis and with significant liver damage in addition to
malnutrition, certain kidney diseases, and other rarer causes
Trauma, sepsis, or severe burns may rapidly lower the albumin level secondary to fluid
shifts
Prothrombin time (Protime, PT) and INR
The liver makes all of the clotting factors, except factor VIII. With severe liver disease,
the ability of the blood to clot may be compromised
Elevated PT/INR may also be caused by hepatocellular disease or Vitamin K
deficiency
To determine the etiology of increased PT in patients with cholestasis, give Vitamin K
10mg IM and recheck PT/INR in 24 hours. If hepatocellular function is satisfactory,
PT will improve by at least 30%

CLINICAL PEARLS
Jaundice is usually not clinically evident until bilirubin level is > 3
In patients with AST:ALT ratio of 2:1 or greater, rise most likely attributable to alcoholic
liver disease. Alcohol cessation over 2–4 weeks often significantly lowers AST and ALT
In patients who consume > 50g alcohol (about 4 drinks per day), incidence of alcoholic
cirrhosis is 8–15% over 10 years
Abnormalities associated with drug-induced liver injury should resolve once drug has been
stopped
Most common causes of asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation are obesity and alcohol
In an asymptomatic middle aged female with elevated liver enzymes, consider primary
biliary cirrhosis and obtain a serum AMA
In evaluating cholestasis, consider ultrasound early in the work-up to rule out bile duct
enlargement
Consider nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in older, obese diabetics
