104. DIVERTICULOSIS AND DIVERTICULITIS
DEFINITION: Diverticulosis is the presence of colonic diverticula (mucosal protrusions/
outpouchings through the muscularis layer of the bowel). 33% of the U.S. population will have
diverticular disease by age 45 and 67% by age 85. Acute diverticulitis refers to inflammation
and microscopic or macroscopic perforation of a diverticula, which occurs in only about 4% of
patients with a history of diverticulosis
PATHOGENESIS
High fat, low fiber diet, e.g., "Western diet" results in decreased bulk of stool which leads
to decreased colon diameter which leads to increased wall tension
Retention of fecal material in a diverticular sac (obstruction of diverticula) compromises
blood flow to the sac and surrounding tissue which leads to inflammation
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Incidence of diverticula increases with age, exponentially at age 50. Patients < 50 with
symptomatic disease are most likely to require surgical intervention
Most common location is sigmoid colon
Incidence higher in men
Incidence in the U.S. and Europe greater than in Asia and Africa
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Patients present because of bleeding and complications of
inflammation (obstruction, abscess, fistula formation)
Diverticulosis: Usually asymptomatic, but may present with painless hematochezia
Complications
Colonic perforation (peritonitis)
Abscess (may be seen on CT for pain not relieved by treatment of acute diverticulitis)
Hemorrhage
Fistula (most often involves bladder)
Ileus or obstruction (from bowel wall inflammation)
EVALUATION
Diverticulosis
If bleeding, then obtain barium enema, colonoscopy or angiography
Diverticulosis is often an incidental finding on colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy
and barium enema
Diverticulitis
Labs
WBC: Normal with diverticulosis, may be elevated with left shift in diverticulitis
CBC: Microcytic anemia may be seen in chronic diverticula
Urinalysis: May include WBC or RBC with fistula formation. Consider urine
culture to screen for stool flora if concern for fistula
Blood culture: Screen for bacteremia
Imaging
CT abdomen: High sensitivity and specificity for acute diverticulitis (thickened
bowel wall, fat stranding, presence of diverticula). Also useful for evaluation of
perforation (free air), obstruction.
Abdominal ultrasound: Similar sensitivity and specificity
Acute abdominal series: Free air (perforation), mass, obstruction
Barium enema: For diagnosis of diverticulosis
Colonoscopy: Direct visualization

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease,
ischemic colitis, urinary tract infection, incarcerated hernia, prostatitis, irritable bowel
syndrome, ovarian pathology (torsion, cyst, mass), ectopic pregnancy
MANAGEMENT
Bleeding diverticulosis
Bowel rest
Consider colonoscopy with cautery, angiogram with vasoconstrictor injection, surgical
consult
Diverticulitis
Outpatient management
Bowel rest: Clear liquid diet initially, cautiously advance as tolerated after
initiation of antibiotics and clinical improvement
Antibiotics: 7–10 day course of oral antibiotics with coverages for gut flora and
anaerobes
Acceptable regimens include Ciprofloxacin/Bactrim + metronidazole, or
Augmentin (monotherapy)
Hospitalization
Indications
Systemic signs or symptoms of infection
Peritonitis/acute abdominal signs
Inability to take oral medications
Lack of clinical improvement after 2–3 days of outpatient treatment
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients should undergo colonoscopy 6–8 weeks after diagnosis of acute diverticulitis
if symptoms resolved to rule out colon cancer. If symptoms not fully resolved, consider
surgical referral
Adherence to a “healthy lifestyle” (low red meat and high fiber diet, normal BMI, vigorous
exercise, nonsmoker) lowers risk for diverticulitis by 50%
Nuts, corn, and popcorn are NOT associated with diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding
