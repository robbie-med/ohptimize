62. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF)
DEFINITIONS
A supraventricular arrhythmia caused by uncoordinated atrial excitation. AF can
promote a rapid ventricular rate, hemodynamic instability, and hypercoagulability due to
ineffective atrial contraction. The terms “acute” and “chronic” were historically used to
delineate types of AF, however duration and permanence have replaced this nomenclature
according to 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart
Rhythm Society guidelines on AF management. While AF typically progresses from
paroxysmal to persistent states, patients can present with both types throughout their lives.
Additionally, this classification applies to recurrent episodes of AF that last more than 30
seconds and that are unrelated to a reversible cause
Paroxysmal AF: AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within seven
days of onset. Episodes can recur with variable frequency
Persistent AF: AF that fails to self-terminate within seven days. Episodes often require
pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm
Long-standing persistent AF: AF that has lasted more than 12 months
Permanent AF: This term is used when the physician and patient make a joint decision
to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm
An important treatment consideration is the presence or absence of valvular anomalies
Nonvalvular AF: AF in the absence of rheumatic mitral stenosis, a mechanical or
bioprosthetic heart valve or mitral valve repair
Valvular AF: AF in the presence of mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve, mitral
valve repair or hemodynamically significant mitral stenosis. This type of atrial
fibrillation is associated with increased risk of stroke
INCIDENCE: AF is the most common arrhythmia. Incidence increases with age and is more
common in men than women. In the U.S. in 2010, the percentage of Medicare fee-for-service
beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation was 2% for those < 65 years of age and 9% for those ≥65
years of age

HISTORY: Consider AF in a patient who presents with the following symptoms: Palpitations,
dyspnea, fatigue, pre-syncope or syncope, dizziness, chest pain, orthopnea. Many patients are
asymptomatic. This is called “subclinical atrial fibrillation” or “SCAF” and is often detected
when the patient has cardiac monitoring for another reason. While SCAF does increase stroke
risk, the optimal anticoagulation strategy is currently unknown
PHYSICAL EXAM: Evaluate blood pressure, heart rate, heart murmurs, lung exam, pulses,
JVD, edema, thyroid gland
WORK-UP
EKG: Irregular R-R intervals, absence of distinct repeating P waves. If EKG does not
reveal AF but history is concerning, consider prolonged evaluation with a cardiac event
monitoring system (i.e., Holter monitor or 30-day event monitor depending on frequency
of patient symptoms)
Echocardiogram: All patients with newly diagnosed AF should have a trans-thoracic
echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate heart structure and function. A trans-esophageal
echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive and specific way to determine if there are
thrombi in the left atrium and can be used to determine if cardioversion or ablation can be
performed in an inpatient setting
Laboratory tests: Thyroid studies, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, blood count.
Additional testing (chest x-ray, urine drug screen, etc.) should be considered depending on
patient’s individual risk factors

GEN
Polysomnography: If obstructive sleep apnea is suspected
MANAGEMENT
Hemodynamically unstable patient: Patients with hypotension, rapid ventricular rate,
or severe symptoms (syncope, hypoxia) should go to the ED for immediate evaluation.
These patients will likely need IV rate control medication and urgent cardioversion. IV
anticoagulation, such as heparin, may also be warranted to prevent stroke in the setting of a
patient with an acute arrhythmia
Common IV medications to control rate: Diltiazem, metoprolol tartrate
Cardioversion: Electrical or pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm. Candidates
for cardioversion
AF present for less than 48 hours
AF present for > 48 hours and TEE shows no atrial thrombus
Unknown duration of AF but patient is anticoagulated for 3–4 weeks
Patient is unstable regardless of duration of AF
AF with rapid ventricular response in patient who does not respond to
pharmacologic therapies for rate control and has ongoing myocardial ischemia
Hemodynamically stable patients: In a patient with stable blood pressure and controlled
ventricular rate, outpatient management can include medications to address rate, rhythm,
and/or anti-coagulation. A rhythm-control approach results in more hospitalizations vs.
the rate-control approach. There is no mortality benefit for either rhythm or rate control.
May consider rhythm control in a younger patient or in a patient who has persistent
symptomatic AF
Rate control
Goal resting heart rate (ventricular rate) < 80 beats per minute. Goal of < 110
beats per minute at rest may be acceptable in patient who is asymptomatic with
preserved LV systolic function. (LOE B)
First line agents: β-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists
(LOE B). Consider a cardio-selective β-blocker in a patient with COPD
β-blockers and usual oral maintenance dose
Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor): 25–100 BID
Metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL): 50–400mg daily
Atenolol: 25–100mg daily
Carvedilol: 3.125–25mg BID
Nadolol: 10–240mg daily
Propranolol: 10–40mg TID or 4 ×/day
Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists: Do NOT use in patients
with decompensated heart failure or LV systolic dysfunction
Verapamil (ER) 180–480mg daily
Diltiazem (ER) 120–360mg daily
Second line agents
Oral amiodarone may be useful for ventricular rate control when β-blocker or
calcium channel blockers are unsuccessful or contraindicated (LOE C) Oral
maintenance dose: 100–200mg daily
Possible adverse effects of amiodarone: Interstitial pneumonitis or
pulmonary fibrosis, hypothyroidism, elevated LFTs/liver disease, corneal
deposits, bradycardia, hypotension
Monitoring: Obtain baseline PFTs, CXR, and thyroid studies before
starting medication. Obtain annual CXR, thyroid studies every 3–6
months, LFTs every 6 months, and periodically check electrolytes
Digoxin
Ineffective at controlling heart rate during exercise
Adverse effects: AV block, ventricular arrhythmias, rarely aggravation of
sinus node dysfunction
Dose adjustments are required in elderly patients and those with renal
dysfunction. Digoxin also has several drug-drug interactions
271
GEN
Requires frequent monitoring of blood levels
Digoxin was associated with an increase in mortality in the AFFIRM trial rhythm
control
Correct reversible causes of AF before starting a long-term rhythm-control
medication. Examples of medications used for pharmacologic cardioversion and
long-term anti-arrhythmic effect: flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, amiodarone.
Seek expert consultation before using these medications for pharmacologic
cardioversion as many of these medications can have significant adverse effects
including QT prolongation
Surgical options: Usually reserved for patients who fail medical therapy
Ablation therapy: Radiofrequency ablation of abnormal atrial foci done through a
heart catheter
Left atrial appendage obliteration: Surgical removal or ligation of the left atrial
appendage (a sac in the wall of the left atrium where 90% of thrombi are formed).
It does not address the electrical component of AF but reduces risk of stroke
through clot reduction
MAZE procedure: Surgical incisions made in the wall of the atrium to disrupt
overactive electrical pathways or re-entry circuits
ANTI-COAGULATION: A person with nonvalvular AF has 5 times the risk of having
a thromboembolic ischemic stroke as a person in sinus rhythm. The risk of stroke must be
weighed against the risk of bleeding when considering starting anti-coagulation. Generally,
the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of bleeding even in patients with a recurrent bleed, but the
practitioner must use patient-centered decision making when deciding to start anti-coagulation
Estimation of risk
Use the CHA2DSs-VASc score to determine risk of ischemic stroke in patient with AF
Consider anti-coagulation in a patient with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater

Consider use of the HAS-BLED score to evaluate bleeding risk while on anti-coagulation
(Hypertension:—Systolic > 160mmHg), A (Abnormal liver or renal function), S/B
(History of Stroke or bleeding), L (Labile INR), E (Elderly > 65 years-old), D (Use of
drugs that promote bleeding or excessive alcohol use)
A score of 3 or greater indicates a high risk for bleed. Discuss risks and benefits of
anti-coagulation with patient and minimize risk factors
Anti-coagulants: A primary adverse effect of all agents is increased bleeding
Warfarin (Coumadin):Vitamin K antagonist
Indication in both: Non-valvular or valvular atrial fibrillation. Warfarin is the only
anti-coagulant approved for valvular AF
Must obtain frequent INR checks to maintain INR in therapeutic range (usually
2.0–3.0)
Must do a heparin bridge to warfarin (3–5 days of heparin at the start of warfarin
therapy)
Dosing: Varies. Warfarin metabolism can change with foods (especially vitamin
K-rich foods) and multiple medications. Patients have to adhere to consistent diets
and may need to monitor dosing more frequently when on medications with drug
interactions
Multiple studies have shown that patients on warfarin therapy are in the
therapeutic range only about 45–60% of the time
Cost: Cheapest long-term anti-coagulant available
Antidote: Vitamin K
Dabigatran (Pradaxa): Direct thrombin inhibitor
Indication: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
150mg BID superior to warfarin for stroke prevention
Less intra-cranial but more overall bleeding events compared to warfarin
Dosing: 150mg BID if CrCl > 30mL/minute, 75mg BID if CrCl 15–30mL/minute,
Not recommended if CrCl < 15mL/minute
Adverse effects: Dyspepsia
Antidote: Praxbind (FDA approved in 2016)
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto): Factor Xa inhibitor
Indication: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
Similar rates of major bleed as warfarin but less fatal bleeding, less intracranial
hemorrhage
Dosing: 20mg daily for CrCl > 50mL/minute, 15mg daily for CrCl 15–50mL/
minute, Not recommended for CrCl < 15mL/minute
Possible drug interactions
P-glycoprotein inhibitors: Ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, conivaptan
P-glycoprotein inducers: Phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort
Antidote: Andexxa (FDA approved in 2018)
Apixaban (Eliquis): Factor Xa inhibitor
Indication: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
Fewer strokes and fewer major bleeding events compared to warfarin. Similar GI
bleed complications
273
GEN
Dosing: 5.0 or 2.5mg BID (Use 2.5mg BID if any of the following are present: Cr
≥1.5mg/dL, ≥80 years of age, body weight ≤60kg)
No data on use in patients with severe or ESRD so do not use in these patients
Antidote: Andexxa (FDA approved in 2018)
Edoxaban (Savaysa): Factor Xa inhibitor
Indication: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
Dose: 60mg daily for CrCl > 50mL/hour, 30mg daily if CrCl 15–50mL/hour.
Avoid if CrCl > 95mL/minute or < 15mL/minute
Avoid in liver disease (Child-Pugh class B or C)
Antidote: Andexxa (FDA approved 2018)
Take home points on anti-coagulants
Warfarin has more drug-drug interactions, diet restrictions, and monitoring
requirements versus the new oral anti-coagulants
The new anti-coagulants have fast onset and offset of action and do not require
bridging therapy. For this reason, they also must be taken consistently—missing a dose
could result in a period of time without active anti-coagulation
Warfarin is the anti-coagulant of choice in patients with severe or end-stage CKD
New oral anti-coagulants have decreased risk of intra-cranial hemorrhage versus
warfarin but require renal dosing adjustment
PRIMARY PREVENTION OF AF
Use an ACE-I or an ARB in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) to prevent new-onset AF. ACE-I or ARB could also be used in
patient with HTN to prevent new-onset AF
A statin may be beneficial in a patient who undergoes coronary artery surgery for the
prevention of new-onset AF
