71. EVALUATION OF DIARRHEA IN ADULTS
INTRODUCTION
Definitions
Diarrhea: Alteration in normal bowel movement characterized by increase in water
content, volume or frequency of stools
Acute diarrhea: Episode < 14 days in duration
Persistent diarrhea: Episode > 14 days in duration
Infectious diarrhea: Diarrhea from an infectious etiology
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Viral: Rotavirus, Norwalk, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, HIV
Bacterial: Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens
Parasitic: Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium
Drugs: Laxatives, antibiotics, caffeine, alcohol, digitalis
Inflammatory: Ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, ischemic colitis, pseudomembranous
colitis (C. difficile)
Malabsorption: Sprue, lymphoma, Whipple’s disease, pancreatic insufficiency, lactose
intolerance
Tumors: Intestinal carcinoma, carcinoid, islet-cell tumors, medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid, villous adenoma
Functional: Irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis
Postsurgical: Postgastrectomy dumping syndrome, parasympathetic denervation, short
bowel syndrome, enteroenteric fistulas
Other: Cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, Addison’s disease, scleroderma, amyloidosis, radiation
enteritis
HISTORY
General: Fever, tenesmus, symptoms of dehydration (i.e., light-headedness, decreased
urine output, lethargy), onset (abrupt vs. gradual), duration
Stool characteristics: Frequency, quantity, consistency, volume, blood, pus, mucus, greasy
stools
Abdominal pain
Exposure: Travel history (developing areas, camping), day care, exposure to persons who
are ill, ingestion of raw or undercooked meat or seafood, raw milk, sexual contacts (oral-
anal, receptive anal intercourse), visit to farm or petting zoo
Medication/Drug history: Recent antibiotics, laxative use, antacids, excessive alcohol,
caffeinated beverages, sorbitol (sugar-free gum or candy)
Past medical history: Immunosuppression, HIV/AIDS, prior gastrectomy
Other: Headaches, myalgias, confusion
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Temperature, blood pressure, pulse, weight
Oral: Dry membranes
Skin: Decreased skin turgor, rash, jaundice
Abdomen: Guarding, rebound tenderness, hypo-or hyperactive bowel sounds,
hepatomegaly, ascites, or masses
Rectal: Guaiac stool, fistulas

EVALUATION
Features concerning for infectious diarrhea
History: Fever, abdominal pain, tenesmus, bloody stool, nausea/vomiting
Physical: Abdominal pain, bloody or heme-positive stool
Laboratory: Fecal WBCs > 50 HPF, fecal lactoferrin
Indications for stool studies
There have been numerous approaches recommended. In numerous studies yield in all
cultures is between 1% and 5%, Grossly bloody stool increased yield to 30%
In general, reserve testing for symptoms lasting > 3–7 days, in setting of severe
dehydration, bloody stools, or immunosuppression
Stool studies may include culture and sensitivity (notify lab if evaluating for E. coli
0157), Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, ova and parasites, C. difficile
toxin. Ova and parasite are rarely indicated in developed countries, with the exception
of community outbreaks
Additional studies should be tailored to the signs and symptoms and may include CBC,
electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, urinalysis, abdominal radiography, anoscopy, flexible
sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy
In patients with persistent diarrhea, consider further evaluation for other entities
including inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease), irritable
bowel syndrome, ischemic bowel disease, laxative abuse, partial obstruction, and other
entities as mentioned in II.B. above
MANAGEMENT OF INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA (Note: Management of other etiologies
mentioned in II. above, is tailored to specific diagnosis. Duration of treatment below is for
immunocompetent patients)
Replace fluid loss orally if possible. In patients with mild diarrhea use clear juices and
soups and with more severe diarrhea or dehydration use oral rehydration solutions
Avoid antimotility agents in patients with bloody diarrhea or infection with Shiga toxin-
producing E. coli. In patients without these entities, consider Imodium: 4mg PO initially,
then 2mg after each unformed stool to maximum of 16mg/day or use Pepto-Bismol 2 tabs
or 30mL up to 4 ×/day. Avoid in pregnant women
Institute therapy for
Traveler’s diarrhea
Fluoroquinolone: Cipro 500mg BID × 1–3 days
Azithromycin 500mg daily × 1–3 days or 1000mg × 1 dose, antibiotic of choice in
children (10mg/kg/day × 3 days) and pregnant women, and for quinolone-resistant
Campylobacter (such as Thailand, Nepal)
Rifaximin (Xifaxan) 200mg TID × 3 days for noninvasive strain of E coli
Shigellosis: Cipro 500mg PO BID × 3–5 day or Levaquin 500mg PO daily × 3–5 days;
Azithromycin 10mg/kg/day for children
Campylobacter: Azithromycin 500mg PO daily × 3 days
Giardia: Metronidazole (Flagyl) 250mg PO TID × 5–7 days or Tinidazole (Tindamax)
2g in 1 dose
Cholera: Doxycycline 300mg × 1 dose or Ciprofloxacin 1g × 1 dose or Azithromycin
1g × 1 dose (20mg/kg × 1, max 1g)
Clostridium difficile: Stop offending antibiotics. Metronidazole (Flagyl) 250mg PO 4
×/day × 10–14 days or Vancomycin 125–500mg PO 4 ×/day × 10–14 days
Etiologies not usually requiring antibiotics
Salmonella: Unless patient is > 50 years or has prosthesis, valvular heart disease,
severe atherosclerosis, malignancy, or uremia
Yersinia: Antibiotics not usually required unless severe infection or
immunocompromised
E. coli 0157: Treatment with ATBs has been shown to increase production of Shiga
toxin and may increase likelihood of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Treatment
with antibiotics has not been shown to ameliorate illness
Decrease risk of transmission to contacts with hand washing and good hygiene

GEN
CLINICAL PEARLS
Treatment of salmonella with antibiotics may prolong the carrier state. Institute therapy
when systemic spread is considered, but not to reduce secondary transmission (can be
accomplished with hand washing)
Traveler’s diarrhea can occur from contaminated ice cubes or water used to wash fruits or
vegetables
Patients taking Flagyl for an infectious diarrhea should avoid alcohol (may cause an
Antabuse-like reaction)
Test for HIV in patients diagnosed with Cryptosporidium
