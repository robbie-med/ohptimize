18. ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER
(ADHD)
INTRODUCTION
Definition:A psychological disorder that is characterized by a short attention span,
impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity
Prevalence of 5–10% of school aged children. The most common neurobehavioral
disorder in childhood
Male to female ratio 3:1
High prevalence in first-degree relatives and twins, i.e., genetic component is likely
Increased risk with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, exposure to drugs of abuse in utero, prior
brain injury, and AIDS
HISTORY
Evaluate for ADHD in any child presenting with complaint of inattention, impulsivity,
hyperactivity, academic underachievement, or behavioral problems
Assess school performance at each visit for all children
Use strict DSM-V criteria to diagnose ADHD and specify subtype (See below)
Obtain evidence directly from parents or caregivers regarding DSM-V criteria
The use of specialized questionnaires and ratings scales is helpful. Connor’s scales
have sensitivity and specificity of over 94% in high risk populations (the use of Global,
nonspecific questionnaires and ratings scales that assess for a variety of behavioral
conditions is not recommended in the diagnosis of ADHD)
Evidence regarding core symptoms, duration of symptoms, and degree of impairment
from classroom teacher or other school professional is required
If a child routinely spends a significant amount of time in another setting (daycare,
etc.), evidence concerning diagnosis can be obtained from professionals in that setting.
Discrepancies between sources is common and should lead the physician to seek
information from further sources
Evaluate for coexisting conditions (depression, anxiety, learning disabilities, oppositional
defiant disorder, conduct disorder) as they are present up to 33% of the time
PHYSICAL EXAM
Thorough physical exam including complete neurologic exam
Any abnormalities should prompt work-up for another diagnosis, as there are no physical
findings of ADHD
LABS/OTHER TESTS
Generally lab studies are not indicated unless directed by the history or physical exam
If indicated, consider CBC, iron studies, lead level, thyroid tests
Consider chromosomal studies if mental retardation or fragile X (etc.) are suspected
EEG if seizures (absence seizures) are suspected
EKG and other cardiac considerations
A supplementary statement released in August 2008 by the American Academy of
Pediatrics did NOT recommend getting an electrocardiogram (EKG) to screen for
heart problems before prescribing stimulants. However, if the patient has suspected
cardiac disease including suspected arrhythmia and/or syncope, an EKG should be
obtained

DSM-V CRITERIA FOR ADHD
People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-
impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development
Inattention: 6 or more symptoms of inattention for children up to age 16, or 5 or more
for adolescents 17 and older and adults; symptoms of inattention have been present for
at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for developmental level
Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in school-
work, at work, or with other activities
Often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities
Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork,
chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses focus, side-tracked)
Often has trouble organizing tasks and activities
Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a
long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework)
Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (e.g., school materials, pencils,
books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones)
Is often easily distracted
Is often forgetful in daily activities
Hyperactivity and Impulsivity
Diagnostic criteria
6 or more symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 16
5 or more for adolescents 17 and older and adults
Symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to
an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the person’s developmental level
Typical observed behaviors
Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat
Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected
Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or
adults may be limited to feeling restless)
Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly
Is often “on the go” acting as if “driven by a motor”
Often talks excessively
Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed
Often has trouble waiting his/her turn
Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games)
In addition, the following conditions must be met
Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age
12 years
Several symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school or
work; with friends or relatives; in other activities)
There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, school, or work functioning
The symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., Mood Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Disorder, or a
Personality Disorder)
Based on the types of symptoms, 3 kinds (presentations) of ADHD can occur
Combined Presentation: If enough symptoms of both criteria inattention and
hyperactivity-impulsivity were present for the past 6 months
Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: If enough symptoms of inattention, but
not hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months
Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: If enough symptoms of
hyperactivity-impulsivity but not inattention were present for the past 6 months
Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over time
as well

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ADHD
Dysfunctional family
Acute family stressors: e.g., divorce, death
Poor parenting: Lack of limit setting, teen parents, parental depression, mental illness
in parents
Learning disability
Mental retardation or lower IQ
Hearing or visual disorder
Oppositional defiant disorder
Conduct disorder
Cognitive impairment from other disorders
Lead poisoning
Medication reaction (Theophylline, Phenobarbital, antihistamines)
Hyperthyroidism
Childhood depression
Inappropriate parental expectations for normal developmental maturity
Tourette’s syndrome
Absence seizures
TREATMENT
Establish a management plan that recognizes ADHD as a chronic condition. Educate
parents, coordinate health services, offer support groups
Set appropriate target outcomes that are realistic, attainable, and measurable
Parental interventions
Rules and limits: Must be consistent and firm in enforcing them; consequences should
be predictable
Environmental structure: Routines at home will help the child accept consistency
Reinforce positive behavior: One method involves a “token economy” where the child
earns tokens for good behavior, doing homework, finishing tasks, etc., and then trades
in the tokens for rewards
Set aside time each day where all of the attention is on the child (reading or playing
age appropriate games)
Provide a special place for doing homework that is quiet and free of distractions
Teacher interventions
Seat the child in the front of the classroom
Allow the child to move around occasionally by having him/her hand out papers or
erase the chalkboard
Keep instructions brief and clear
Give the child positive reinforcement whenever possible
A weekly report will allow parents to monitor behavior
Supervise the child closely in the cafeteria or the playground (fighting or acting out)
Medications
Stimulants
Stimulants are highly effective
No single stimulant has been proven superior over another, but individual chil-
dren respond differently to different stimulants, therefore, try at least 3 different
stimulants (short- and long-acting) before abandoning the class (80% of children
will respond to at least one)
Monitor height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate for cardiac adverse effects of
stimulants
Side-effects of stimulants include insomnia, headache, stomachaches, and appe-
tite suppression which can lead to weight loss. Stimulants can also cause or
exacerbate vocal and motor tics
“Drug holidays” over weekends or school holidays are not recommended since
ADHD is a chronic condition present in all settings. This area is controversial, so
therapy should be individualized for the child

PEDS
Stimulants can be delivered by immediate-release (IR) or extended-release
(ER) formulations. Extended release formulations use multiple bead, osmotic-
controlled release, or prodrug systems to increase adherence or avert drug
diversion

Refer to psychiatrist if patient has true treatment failure or has comorbidities
CLINICAL PEARLS
Stimulants can cause weight loss, but do not affect overall growth potential
The normal attention span is approximately 3–5 minutes per year of age
Controlled studies have NOT shown that children with ADHD benefit from dietary control
of sugar and other additives
Studies exploring the link between television exposure and ADHD have had inconsistent
results
Recognizing and treating ADHD is extremely important for the patient’s long-term
prognosis. Studies have shown that untreated hyperactive boys showed a significantly
higher rate of adult psychiatric problems including antisocial and drug abuse disorders
