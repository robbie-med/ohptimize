93. CORTICOSTEROID INJECTION OF JOINTS
INTRODUCTION: Joint aspiration and injection can be a part of any primary care office.
Aspiration can give symptomatic relief and a quick diagnosis with fluid analysis. Joint injection
can be part of a diagnostic exam of a painful joint (Lidocaine) or part of a treatment plan
(steroids)
GENERAL LIST OF CONDITIONS IMPROVED WITH STEROID INJECTION
Articular conditions: Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis associated
with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, Reiter’s syndrome, gout, pseudogout,
osteoarthritis, lupus arthrosis, post-traumatic arthritis
Nonarticular disorders: Fibrositis, bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, tenosynovitis/tendonitis,
tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow, plantar fasciitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, tarsal tunnel
syndrome, costochondritis, Tietze’s syndrome
CONTRAINDICATIONS TO JOINT INJECTION/ASPIRATION
Cellulitis or broken skin over the entry site
Coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation (relative contraindication)
Prostheses
Intra-articular fracture, unstable joint
Septic effusion
Lack of response after two previous injections (steroids)
Allergy to injected medication
Same joint injected less than three months ago
Achilles or patella tendinopathies
SIDE-EFFECTS
Steroid arthropathy (1–10% of patients)
Tendon rupture
Skin atrophy, depigmentation
Iatrogenic infectious arthritis (1 in 3,000–5,000 injections)
Acceleration of cartilage attrition
Lipodystrophy
Transient hyperglycemia (most important for diabetics)
TECHNIQUE: Follow standard sterile procedure for any procedure where skin barrier is
broken. Locate your landmarks and mark entry point with thumbnail or pen. Prep area and
aspirate the joint. Use hemostat to hold needle in place if syringes are switched to inject joint.
Never inject directly into a nerve or tendon
Knee (superior lateral approach): Place the knee in a slightly flexed position (30°) by
placing a towel under the popliteal space. Find the superior lateral border of the patella.
Mark a point perpendicular to the 2 borders at a level just posterior to the patella (avoiding
the quadriceps tendon and IT band). Insert needle perpendicular to the axis of the knee and
guide the needle under the patella. There should be no resistance
Subacromial bursa: Locate the lateral edge of the acromion at the posterior shoulder.
joint. Use the needle cap to mark the area about 1cm × 1cm inferior and medial to the tip
of the acromion. Insert the needle underneath the acromion at about 45° aiming towards
the coracoid process. Needle should move freely in the space
Plantar fascia: Medial approach is done with the patient seated or lying supine with the
foot in a supinated position. Measure about 5cm distally from the insertion of the Achilles
(towards the toes) and 2cm cephalad from the insertion of the Achilles and mark this site

with the needle cap. From the medial side of the foot insert the needle perpendicular to the
bottom of the heel and superior to the heel fat pad at this location
Greater trochanter: Localize the greater trochanter of the hip by internally and externally
rotating the hip palpating for the bony prominence on the lateral aspect of the hip. Mark
the site of most tenderness with a needle cap. Insert needle over the point of maximum
tenderness making sure that the needle remains perpendicular to the greater trochanter.
Patient will usually have pain when the needle enters the bursa
Olecranon bursa: Place the elbow at 90° of flexion and insert the needle into the area
of most fluid. Tensing the bursa in your opposite hand may help you to localize the best
insertion site. Do not inject steroid into the olecranon bursa
Carpal tunnel: Dorsiflex the wrist to 30° and locate the palmaris longus tendon (have
patient touch 1st and 5th digits together). Insert the needle proximal to the carpal tunnel
and radial to the palmaris longus. Advance the needle downward at a 45°angle toward
the middle finger. Advance the needle 1–2cm until there is no resistance. If there is any
discomfort in the fingers pull back the needle and redirect
Acromioclavicular joint: With patient seated and arms relaxed to sides, the joint sulcus is
identified.A superior approach is used to guide needle into posterior portion of joint. Need
to fan out the medication in this space
De Quervain’s tenosynovitis: Tendon identified by placing thumb in the hitchhiking
position. With thumb relaxed, insert needle into the tendon sheath. Movement of thumb
will identify if needle has been placed in tendon. Do not inject tendon directly. Injection
will meet little resistance if needle is in proper position
Glenohumeral joint: A posterior approach is used. Location for needle insertion is
approximately 2cm medial to posterior lateral corner of the acromion. Needle is inserted
into joint while aiming at the coracoid process. This injection should be performed under
ultrasound guidance if available to ensure accuracy of steroid placement
