88. KNEE PAIN
ANATOMY
Bursae: Provide lubrication between dynamic components
Cruciate ligaments
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL): Prevents anterior motion of the tibia on the femur
Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL): Prevents posterior motion of the tibia on the femur
External tendons and ligaments
Quadriceps tendon: Insertion of quadriceps muscle to superior patella
Patellar tendon: Forms the distal portion of quadriceps muscle to the tibia
Medial collateral ligament (MCL): Stabilizes knee to prevent excess valgus motion
Lateral collateral ligament (LCL): Stabilized knee to prevent excess varus motion
Muscles
Knee flexors: Hamstrings and gastrocnemius
Knee extensors: Quadriceps
Articulations
Lateral and medial tibiofemoral articulations
Patellofemoral articulation
HISTORY
Acute trauma: Pain which began suddenly during a certain activity. Position of the knee
when injured (flexed, extended, etc.), or as a result of a direct blow
Chronic trauma: Activities
Swelling
Immediate swelling after the injury suggests fracture, ACL injury or patellar
dislocation
Delayed swelling suggests meniscal injury or osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)
Mechanical symptoms: Catching or locking suggests meniscal injury
Buckling/Instability: May indicate patellar subluxation or ligamentous rupture
Aggravating and relieving factors (stairs, sitting, etc.)
History of patellar dislocation
Problems elsewhere in the lower extremity: One joint above and one joint below. Hip or
foot problems, new shoes, etc.
Systemic illness: Polyarthralgia, fever, morning stiffness, history of gout, hyperuricemia,
rheumatoid arthritis, or pseudogout
Past history: Knee injury, past surgeries of the knee
PHYSICAL EXAM: Compare to uninjured side
Visually inspect knee for effusion or soft tissue swelling, evidence of past surgeries/
injuries, abrasions, contusions, ecchymosis, erythema, patellar location. Visually inspect
leg muscles for atrophy, leg length discrepancy, etc.
Palpate for pain, warmth, or effusion
Range of motion, crepitus, gait, patellar grind, strength, reflexes
Patella
Evaluate for effusion by “milking” the suprapatellar pouch with patient supine and
injured knee in extension
Assess patellofemoral tracking by observing patella for smooth motion while patient
contracts quadriceps
Evaluate for hypermobility of the patella by attempting to “sublux” the patella
medially and laterally
401
MUSC
Apprehension sign: Pain and involuntary contraction of the quadriceps with lateral
deviation of the patella
Lachman test: Evaluate for ACL injury
Method: Patient lies supine with the injured leg in slight external rotation with the
knee in 30° of flexion. Stabilize the distal femur with one hand, grasp the proximal
tibia with the other hand (thumb on tibial tuberosity), and place an anterior force on
the tibia
Results: The test is positive if there is lack of clear endpoint (tibia translates
anteriorly). This is the most sensitive test for ACL injury
Drawer tests: Evaluate for ACL or PCL injury
Method: Anterior and posterior drawer tests—patient is supine with the knee flexed
90° and the plantar aspect of the foot resting on the table. The examiner sits on the
patient’s foot and then grasps the proximal aspect of the tibia with both hands and
attempts to anteriorly or posteriorly translate the tibia on the femur
Results: Anterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur suggests injury to the ACL and
posterior subluxation suggests injury to the PCL
Tibial sag test: Evaluate for PCL injury
Method: Place patient in the supine position with knees and hips flexed to 90°
Results: Affected tibia “sags” on the femur (inferior displacement due to gravity)
suggesting a PCL injury
Varus-valgus stress test: Evaluate for MCL or LCL injury
Method: Patient is supine and a varus or valgus stress is placed on the knee with the
examiner’s hand. Varus and valgus stress should be tested in full extension and with
30° of knee flexion
Results: Laxity with valgus stress suggests injury to the MCL, and laxity with varus
stress suggests injury to the LCL
McMurray test: Evaluate for meniscus injury
Method: With the patient supine and the knee flexed at 90°, stabilize the femur with
one hand while externally rotating the foot and then extending the knee. Repeat with
the foot internally rotated (while stabilizing the femur), and then extend the knee
Results: A test is positive with pain and/or a palpable click/clunk at the medial or
lateral joint lines
Apley grind test: Evaluate for meniscus injury
Method: With the patient prone and the knee flexed at 90°, apply an axial load rotate
the foot clockwise and counterclockwise (compresses the meniscus). Repeat by
pulling up on the foot (distraction of the joint) and then rotating the foot clockwise and
counterclockwise
Results: If there is pain with axial load, but no pain with distraction, then consider a
meniscus injury
RADIOGRAPHY/SPECIAL TESTS
Radiography: Evaluate for osteoarthritis, fracture, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD),
dislocation, Osgood-Schlatter’s disease, etc.
MRI: Meniscus injury, ligament injury, internal derangement, occult fracture or bone
bruise
Aspiration of knee effusion: Aspirate to evaluate for hemarthrosis, infection (septic joint),
gout, fat globules (fracture), and for symptomatic relief
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF COMMON KNEE
PROBLEMS
Fracture: Obtain x-ray with appropriate suspicion (mechanism, swelling, deformity, joint
tenderness etc.) and orthopedic referral if positive. The Ottawa knee rules are a useful
guide for indications to order x-ray
Meniscus injuries
History
Twisting, flexion injury
402
MUSC
Inability to flex knee
Difficulty in bearing weight
“Mechanical symptoms” (clicking or locking of the knee)
If chronic, may see intermittent knee joint effusions, locking, and possibly
quadriceps wasting
Physical exam
Knee effusion
Tenderness over joint line (medial with medial meniscus injury, lateral with lateral
meniscus injury)
Positive McMurray test and Apley test: See above for method
Management
Acute: Avoid provocative maneuvers that reproduce symptoms, crutches, ice, rest
For degenerative non traumatic meniscal tears, physical therapy and structured
exercise programs are first-line treatments
Despite lack of high-quality studies examining effectiveness of oral analgesics for
meniscal tears, NSAIDs or Acetaminophen are commonly prescribed
Refer to orthopedist if mechanical symptoms and pain are present after resolution
of acute inflammation. Physical therapy for degenerative meniscal tears may be
more effective than knee arthroscopy in patients > 35 years of age
Ligament injuries
History
Pain immediately at time of injury (mechanism of injury)
Sensation of, or audible popping at time of injury
Knee stiffness and tenderness
Knee swelling (occasionally)
Decreased ability to ambulate
Physical exam
Tenderness to palpation of ligament (MCL, LCL)
Lachman test: Positive with ACL injury (See above)
Drawer tests (test for ACL, PCL injury) and tibial sag test (PCL injury)
Tests for lateral instability (MCL, LCL)
Classification
Grade I—Stretching of fibers without significant damage
Grade II—Partial tear of fibers
Grade III—Complete tear of fibers
Management
Ice, elevation, rest
Rigid knee immobilizer or posterior splint
Crutches for grade II and III injuries
Orthopedic/sports medicine referral/surgery
Physical therapy
Patellofemoral syndrome
Etiology
Lateral subluxation (Hypermobility of the patella)
May be caused by increased angle between the quadriceps and patellar tendon
(Q angle). A Q angle greater than 15° is a predisposing factor for patellar
subluxation
Other causes include pes planus and variation in hip anatomy that results in
compensatory tibial torsion
Chondromalacia: Damage to soft cartilage on posterior patella causing crepitus
and pain
History
Pain worsened by walking or running up or down hills, climbing stairs or kneeling
Pain often disappears during activity and returns just after activity is completed
Physical exam
Hypermobility of the patella
403
MUSC
Pain or crepitus with patellofemoral movement
Apprehension sign: Pain and involuntary contraction of the quadriceps with
deviation of the patella laterally
Patellar grind test
Possible knee effusion
Testing
Usually, a clinical diagnosis
If x-rays are obtained, include weight-bearing AP, weight bearing true lateral, and
axial (taken with 20° and 45° of knee flexion)
Management
Ice (If swelling or decreased range of motion present)
NSAIDs
Physical therapy (quadriceps strengthening, hip rotator strengthening)
Orthotics if needed for foot overpronation
Lateral buttress patellar bracing lacks strong evidence for both benefit and harm
Surgical consideration if conservative therapy fails
Osgood-Schlatter’s disease (Apophysitis of the tibial tubercle)
General
Common cause of knee pain in males age 13–14; females age 10–11
Secondary to traction of the patellar tendon where it inserts into the growth plate
of the tibial tubercle
Pain is at the insertion of the patellar tendon on the tibial tubercle
History
Pain with activity (especially with running, jumping, kneeling) waxing and
waning for months
Recent growth spurt
Often bilateral
Physical exam
Prominence over the tibial tubercle
Tenderness at the tibial tubercle
Tightness of quadriceps and hamstring muscles
May have pain with resisted knee extension
Management
Avoid activities that involve knee extension (running, climbing, jumping, kicking)
until symptoms have subsided ~6–8 weeks
Range of motion and stretching: Physical therapy
Oral analgesics, ice after activity
Surgical management if pain persists after ossification is complete
Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Etiology unknown
General
Intraarticular osteochondrosis characterized by degeneration and recalcification of
articular cartilage and underlying bone
The affected bone and overlying cartilage gradually loosen and cause pain
This osteochondral fragment may break loose into the joint and cause locking,
sharp pain and effusion
Rule out OCD in contralateral joint; 20–30% of cases are bilateral
History: Gradual onset of swelling and vague pain. Worse with activity. Insidious onset
may be over several months
Physical exam: Often pain with palpation of the medial femoral condyle (most
common site is the lateral portion of the medial condyle). Quadriceps wasting
Decreased ROM of the knee
Radiologic diagnosis with plain films
MRI needed to stage the lesion
Orthopedic referral
