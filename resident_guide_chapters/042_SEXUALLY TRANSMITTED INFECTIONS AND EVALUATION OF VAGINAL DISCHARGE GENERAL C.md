42. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND
EVALUATION OF VAGINAL DISCHARGE
GENERAL
Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the
U.S. (followed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae), and most of these infections are asymptomatic
An estimated 3% of the population aged 18 to 35 has untreated chlamydia infection and
5% has untreated gonorrhea infection
The most common infectious etiologies for vaginal discharge, odor, pruritus, and/or
discomfort are bacterial vaginosis, Candida vulvovaginitis, and trichomoniasis
HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM
History
Discharge: New-onset or change in volume, color or odor
Other symptoms: Pruritus, erythema, irritation, burning, dysuria, spotting, dyspareunia
Predisposing factors: New sexual partner, recent use of antibiotics, history of diabetes
or HIV, immunosuppressed state, pregnancy, use of corticosteroids
Associated symptoms: Fever, abdominal/pelvic pain, testicular pain
Physical exam
Visually inspect for discharge, lesions, skin changes, erythema, warts
Bimanual examination in women: Uterine, adnexal or cervical motion tenderness (CMT)
Testicular exam in men: Testicular enlargement, tenderness, masses
Abdominal examination
Rectal exam in men (prostatitis)
LABORATORY
Consider testing for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia cultures if indicated. If positive, test for
syphilis and HIV.
Gonorrhea and Chlamydia: Consider first-catch urine or vaginal/endocervical swabs.
In men, urethral swab for first-catch urine sample. NAATs recommended. Vaginal
swabs can be clinician or patient-collected
Blood work: Consider testing for HIV and syphilis (RPR)
Syphilis usually screened with a non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL), and confirmed
with a treponemal test (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA), also treponemal tests
may also be used for screening
Appearance of discharge
White, cottage cheese, yeast smell: Suggests Candida
Green, bubbly, with “strawberry spots” on vaginal walls and cervix: suggests
Trichomonas
Grey, low viscosity, adherent to vaginal walls: suggests bacterial vaginosis
Vaginal pH
pH 3.5 to 4.5: Candida
pH > 4.5: Bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella); pH < 4.5, it is unlikely patient has BV
pH > 6: Trichomonas
pH > 7: Atrophic
Wet mount (KOH and saline): Apply 2 samples to 2 areas of slide, then place 1 drop of
KOH to the first and normal saline to the other. Cover and examine under microscope
169
ID
Pseudomycelia: Candida (there is a significant false negative rate with wet mounts for
Candida. If the wet mount is negative and Candida is suspected, then treat empirically
and/or plate specimen on Nickerson's agar)
Clue cells, positive “whiff ” test: Bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella)
Clue cells: Epithelial cells appear stippled due to presence of bacteria
“Whiff test:” Bacterial vaginosis infection will give off characteristic fishy odor
when saturated with KOH. The presence of Lactobacillus or pH < 4.5 excludes the
diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis
Motile organisms with flagella: Trichomonas
Culture: If microscopy is negative, culture for Candida species or Trichomonas is
important because microscopy is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude Candida in
symptomatic patients. Similarly, a diagnostic test using nucleic acid amplification (NAAT),
if available, is strongly advised if trichomoniasis is suspected
TREATMENT
Candida vaginitis: Symptoms: External dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and
redness. Signs: Vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, or thick curdy vaginal discharge
Oral: Fluconazole (Diflucan)—150mg PO as single dose
Intravaginal OTC products
Clotrimazole 1% cream: 5g intravaginally × 7–14 days
Clotrimazole 2% cream: 5g intravaginally × 3 days

Herpes simplex virus (HSV): First episode — can obtain viral culture to confirm
diagnosis. Lesions characterized as grouped vesicles on erythematous base, will eventually
ulcerate with crusting. Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of
therapy
Acute treatment (choose 1)
Acyclovir: 400mg PO TID × 7–10 days
Acyclovir: 200mg PO 5 ×/day × 7–10 days
Famciclovir: 250mg PO TID × 7–10 days
Valacyclovir: 1g PO BID × 7–10 days
Suppressive therapy: Reduces rate of recurrences by 70–80%. Recurrences diminish
over time so periodically assess continued need for therapy (choose 1)
Acyclovir: 400mg PO BID
Famciclovir: 250mg PO BID
Valacyclovir: 1g PO once a day
Valacyclovir: 500mg PO once a day (might be less effective in persons who have
≥10 episodes/year)
Chlamydial (C. trachomatis) infection
Recommended regimen
Azithromycin 1g PO as a single dose —OR—
Doxycycline 100mg PO 2 ×/day for 7 days (contraindicated in 2nd and 3rd
trimester of pregnancy)
Alternative regimens (choose one)
Erythromycin base 500mg PO 4 ×/day for 7 days

170
ID
See section D for co-infection with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis
Test-of-cure for treatment failure not recommended unless there are persistent
symptoms, concern for reinfection, or unclear adherence to treatment. Should not
repeat NAAT within 3 weeks or therapy to avoid false positive result
However, both men and women should be retested 3 months after treatment or at
next follow-up. Sex partners should also be referred for testing and possible treatment
if sexual contact occurred 60 days preceding symptom onset or diagnosis
Uncomplicated gonococcal (N. gonorrhoeae) infections of the cervix, urethra, and
rectum
Recommended regimen
Ceftriaxone: 500mg in a single intramuscular dose (1g for patients weighing ≥150
kg) —AND—
Oral Doxycycline: 100mg twice daily for 7 days (when chlamydial infection has
not been excluded)
Azithromycin no longer recommended due to increasing resistance in N.
gonorrhoeae. If pregnant, Azithromycin 1g orally as single dose is recommended
to treat chlamydia
Alternative regimens if ceftriaxone not available:
Gentamycin: 240mg IM as single dose AND Azithromycin 2g orally as single
dose —OR—
Cefixime: 800mg orally as a single dose AND Doxycycline 100mg twice daily for
7 days
Uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx
Recommended regimen
Ceftriaxone: 500mg in a single IM dose (1g for patients weighing ≥150kg)
—AND—
Oral Doxycycline: 100mg twice daily for 7 days (when chlamydial infection has
not been excluded)
If pregnant,Azithromycin 1g orally as single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia
No reliable alternative treatments recommended, consult ID if severe allergy to
ceftriaxone
Syphilis (Treponema pallidum)
Should be classified as primary (ulcers or chancre at infection site), secondary (skin
rash, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy), tertiary, or latent (no clinical
manifestations)
Penicillin G (parental) is the preferred treatment for all stages of infection, including
during pregnancy. Appropriate preparation, length, and duration of treatment depends
on classification
Treatment by classification
Primary, secondary, or early latent: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM as
a single dose
Late/unknown duration latent or tertiary syphilis with normal CSF: Benzathine
penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 IM doses of 2.4 million units
weekly for 3 weeks
Pediatric infection, neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis: Reference current CDC
treatment guidelines
Caution patients to Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (acute febrile reaction with systemic
symptoms that may occur within 24 hours of starting treatment for syphilis)
Persons who have had sexual contact within 90 days preceding diagnosis should
receive empiric treatment regardless of serologic testing
Clinical and serologic evaluation should occur at 6 and 12 months after treatment.
Treponemal tests typically remain positive after infection, so assessment of reinfection
should use non-treponemal testing (RPR, VDRL)
Bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella)
Treatment of male partners not useful. Treatment may reduce risk of gonorrhea,
chlamydia, HIV and other viral STDs. No alcohol when taking therapy
171
ID
Metronidazole: 500mg PO BID × 7 days —OR—
Metronidazole gel 0.75%: 1 full applicator (5g) intravaginally once daily × 5 days

Pregnancy: Treatment is recommended for pregnant women in all trimesters
Trichomoniasis: Protozoal flagellate which is sexually transmitted
Metronidazole 2g PO for 1 dose, or 500mg PO BID × 7 days. Metronidazole gel is less
efficacious than PO (< 50%)

CLINICAL PEARLS
Many gonococcal and chlamydial infections are asymptomatic
Genital ulcerations may be caused by syphilis, herpes, chancroid, or lymphogranuloma
venereum. Herpes and chancroid are painful, others are not
Vulvar pruritus is the most common presentation of vulvar dysplasia. If patient has a
negative work-up for vaginitis then patient should be worked up for vulvar dysplasia by
