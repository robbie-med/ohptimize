94. CONCUSSION EVALUATION
DEFINITION: A concussion is a transient post-traumatic alteration in mental status that
may or may not involve loss of consciousness
GENERAL
Incidence: Estimated that 3.8 million concussions occur in the U.S. per year during
competitive sports and other recreational activities
A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining further concussions
Multiple concussions may result in cumulative neurophysiologic deficits
Greater number, severity, or duration of symptoms are predictors of prolonged recovery
time
Concussion sustained while patient is still symptomatic from an earlier concussion may
result in progressive cerebral edema
Up to 50% of concussions may go unreported by athletes or not addressed by coaches
since there is often pressure to continue sports participation
Pre-injury mood disorders, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, and migraine
headaches often complicate the diagnosis and management of concussions
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Possible causes of altered level of consciousness
Axonal shear injury: Often not evident on CT or MRI
Cortical contusion: May result in cerebral edema, ischemia or mass effect
Intracranial hemorrhage
HISTORY—SIGNS/SYMPTOMS
Confusion and/or disorientation currently or at the time of event
Amnesia to event and length of time of amnesia
Headache; including duration, frequency, exacerbating factors, etc.
Nausea/vomiting
Dizziness/vertigo/balance problems
Vision disturbances (blurred, double, photophobia)
Sensitivity to noise or tinnitus
Sensitivity to light
Fatigue or sleep disturbances
Memory dysfunction/poor attention and concentration
Mood changes (anxiety, depression, irritability)
Exacerbation of symptoms with exertion
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Altered level of consciousness, dazed appearance, inappropriate behavior, slurred
or incoherent speech, repeating the same question
Eyes: Pupillary concordance/accommodation, papilledema or retinal hemorrhages,
extraocular movements
Neurologic assessment should involve at least the following aspects
Cranial nerve exam
Strength
Sensation
Memory/cognitive evaluation (orientation questions, immediate and delayed 3 item
recall, serial 7’s/months in reverse)—poor concentration is common
423
MUSC
Coordination (finger-to-nose)—poor coordination is common
Gait/Balance testing (modified Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)—See reference
below)—difficulty with testing is common. Hold each position for 20 seconds with
eyes closed and hands on hips
Feet together
Single leg
Tandem stance with one foot in front of the other
Serial monitoring for deterioration over the initial few hours after the injury
CLASSIFICATION: Historically, concussions have been described using several different
grading or classification systems. Concussion grading systems are not clinically relevant, and
this terminology should be avoided
IMAGING/TESTING
Acute: CT scan is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage
or hematoma. Indications include: Continued altered level of consciousness, focal
neurological changes, weakness or paresthesias, incontinence or seizure
Chronic symptoms: MRI is the imaging modality of choice. Indications for MRI include:
Persistent headaches, difficulty concentrating or other signs of post-concussive syndrome
or any of the symptoms/signs listed above for acute imaging. Note: Post-concussive
symptoms which do not persist do not need neuroimaging
Neuropsychological testing: Formal neuropsychological testing should be considered
in patients with chronic symptoms that are not resolving, especially in patients with pre-
injury mood or headache disorders that may complicate management
CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT
Physical and cognitive rest is the mainstay of treatment. Temporary school or work
accommodations are often needed to aid in the recovery process
Ideally athletes should be treated by healthcare providers with training in the field of
sports concussion diagnosis and management
OTC analgesics as needed for headaches–consider avoiding NSAIDS after acute injury
RETURN TO PLAY
A graduated, step-wise return to play can be initiated after the patient has been symptom
free for 24 hours
There is no same day return to play for an athlete suffering a concussion
Note: There should be 24 hours between each step listed below. If any concussive
symptoms return, the patient should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level
Graduated return to sports strategy
Exercise step
Functional exercise at each
step
Goal of each step
1. Symptom-limited activity
Daily activities that do not
provoke symptoms
Gradual reintroduction of
work/school activities
2. Light aerobic exercise
Walking or stationary cycling
at slow to medium pace. No
resistance training
Increase heart rate
3. Sport-specific exercise
Running or skating drills. No
head impact activities
Add movement
4.Non-contact training drills
Harder training drills, e.g.,
passing drills. May start pro-
gressive resistance training
Exercise, coordination, and
increased thinking
424
MUSC
5.Full-contact practice
Following medical clearance,
participate in normal training
activities
Restore confidence and assess
functional skills by coaching
staff
6.Return to play/sport
Normal game play
In this example, it would be typical to have 24 hours (or longer) for each step of the progression. If
any symptoms worsen while exercising, the athlete should go back to the previous step. Resistance
training should be added only in the later stages (Stage 3 or 4 at the earliest).
Written clearance should be provided by a healthcare professional before return to play/sport as direct-
ed by local laws and regulations.

D. Disqualification from sport: There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying or
retiring athletes from a sport or activity. Each case should be carefully evaluated and
discussed with the athlete, parents, and coaches. Things to consider include number of
concussions, duration of postconcussive symptoms, and other complications such as
mood changes
ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
Second-impact syndrome: Return to play prior to full resolution of concussion symptoms
and occurrence of second (even mild) head trauma. Pathophysiology involves loss of
vascular autoregulation, vascular engorgement and subsequent brain herniation. Syndrome
may be fatal
Postconcussive syndrome
Physical, cognitive, and emotional/behavioral symptoms following a concussion
May persist weeks to months or permanently
Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, depression/anxiety,
sensitivity to noise or light, memory problems or impaired concentration. May persist
for weeks to months following the injury
Patient should be evaluated with an MRI and neuropsychiatric testing with persistent
symptoms
Treatment aimed at symptom management
Acetaminophen for headaches
Speech pathology for cognitive impairments
Psychotherapy or medications for depression/anxiety
CLINICAL PEARLS
20–50% of patients with epidural hemorrhage will have a “lucid interval” before the onset
of neurologic deterioration
Epidural hemorrhage usually results from tearing of middle meningeal artery; subdural
hemorrhage results from tearing of bridging veins
CT is more sensitive than MRI for showing an acute bleed. MRI is more sensitive at
showing small areas of axonal shear injury and cerebral contusion
An athlete should not return to play until symptom free and completed a graduated return
to play program
There is no current evidence that mouth guards reduce the severity or prevent concussions
There is an increasing concern that repeated head impact exposure and recurrent
concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae, including chronic cognitive
dysfunction
