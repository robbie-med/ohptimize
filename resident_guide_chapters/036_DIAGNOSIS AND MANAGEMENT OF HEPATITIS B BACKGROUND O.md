36. DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS B
BACKGROUND
One of the major vaccine-preventable diseases. The hepatitis vaccine represents one of
the first true vaccines to prevent cancer
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more than 240 million people worldwide. An
estimated 850,500–2.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic HBV infection, causing
an estimated 1,800 deaths annually. Once chronic infection is established, the spectrum
of illness ranges from a healthy asymptomatic carrier to all of the sequelae of chronic
hepatitis (including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Symptoms in infected
individuals with HBV infection can range from asymptomatic to severe and fulminant
hepatitis
Transmitted by blood or blood products (injection drug use, sexual activity, occupational
exposure, vertical transmission)
Incubation period is 60–150 days. HBV can survive outside of the body for 7 days and
still be capable of causing an infection. Symptoms begin at an average of 90 days after
exposure to HBV
Of adult patients infected with hepatitis B
95% recover completely
5% develop chronic hepatitis or chronic carrier state
Of those with chronic HBV, 20% develop cirrhosis within 20 years
Fulminant hepatitis occurs in < 1%. The mortality rate is about 60%
INTERPRETATION OF LAB TESTS
Overview: First look at HBsAg and HBsAb (See below)
If the HBsAg is positive, the patient usually has either acute Hepatitis B or chronic
infection
If the HBsAb is positive, the patient usually has either had past infection (and is
noninfectious and protected from hepatitis B) or has received the HBV vaccine.
If both are negative (rare), the patient may be in the “window phase” or susceptible to
infection (See below)
If both are positive (rare) (See below)
Tests
HBsAg: First manifestation of HBV infection and persists throughout clinical illness.
Persistence is associated with chronic hepatitis and implies infectivity
HBsAb: Occurs in most patients after clearance of HBsAg and implies non-infectivity
and protection from recurrent HBV infection. (Occasionally, the appearance of HBsAb
is delayed until clearance of HBsAg and during this “window phase,” both HBsAb and
HBsAg may be negative—See below)
HBcAb IgM: Appears during acute hepatitis B and indicates a diagnosis of acute
hepatitis B
HBcAb IgG: Appears during acute hepatitis B and persists indefinitely
HBeAg: Indicates viral replication and infectivity
HBeAb: Follows HBeAg and signifies diminished viral replication
HBV DNA: Usually parallels the presence of HBeAg, but is a more precise marker of
viral replication and infectivity

EVALUATION
Acute hepatitis B
Acute illness usually subsides over 2–3 weeks and lab values are normalized within 16
weeks unless the patient develops chronic hepatitis
The clinical picture is variable, with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic (30%)
to general malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, easy fatigability, anorexia, nausea/vomiting,
diarrhea, fever/chills, and jaundice
Physical exam: Hepatomegaly (> 50%), splenomegaly (15%), lymphadenopathy
Lab: Low WBC, elevated ALT or AST (100–2000 units, ALT usually > AST), elevated
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, elevated prothrombin time (in severe hepatitis),
mild proteinuria, and bilirubinuria
Management
Acute disease: Symptomatic–Rest, good diet, avoidance of hepatotoxins (alcohol,
acetaminophen) and behaviors that transmit hepatitis B
Long-term management: Follow LFTs and HBsAg every month until
disappearance of HBsAg. When this occurs, check for appearance of HBsAb. If
HBsAg is still positive after 6 months, patient has chronic hepatitis
Indications for hospital admission
Encephalopathy
Prothrombin time prolonged > 3 seconds
Intractable vomiting
Hypoglycemia
Age > 45 years
Immunosuppression
Consider anti-viral treatment if fulminant hepatitis or severe protracted course of acute
infection. Entecavir (Baraclude) preferred; can use Lamivudine (Epivir) or Telbivudine
(Tyzeka) if short term duration. Continue until there is documented clearance of
HBsAg or indefinitely if liver transplant needed. Interferon-α is contraindicated. See
IV below for medication classes
Chronic hepatitis B
After the acute infection, chronic hepatitis develops in
90% of infants
25–50% of children 1–5 years-old
5% of adults
Definition: Persistent HBsAg > 6 months, chronic liver inflammation, and
characteristic histologic findings
Chronic active hepatitis (replicative phase)
Persistent HBsAg > 6 months
Persistent presence of HBV DNA or HBeAg
Liver injury (persistent elevation of LFTs > 6 months)
Chronic persistent hepatitis (nonreplicative phase)
Persistent HBsAg > 6 months
Absence of HBV DNA
Minimal liver injury (modest LFT elevation)
Note: Remissions are characterized by the disappearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg (HBsAg
persists). This means that the virus is in a non-replicative phase, and patient is classified as

having chronic persistent hepatitis—an important distinction from chronic active hepatitis,
which is characterized by higher infectivity and greater risk from progression to cirrhosis.
Likelihood of converting from replicative to non-replicative disease is approximately 10–
15%/year
Symptoms and signs
Chronic active hepatitis: Asymptomatic to severe symptoms, especially fatigue.
Possibly jaundice, arthralgias, and anorexia. End-stage includes ascites, edema,
bleeding varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy
Chronic persistent hepatitis: Range from asymptomatic to mild symptoms; fatigue,
anorexia, nausea, and hepatomegaly
Labs: Aminotransferase elevations (usually 100–1000 units), minimally elevated
alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, or prolongation of
prothrombin time
Work-up should include
History and physical exam (identifying risk factors for co-infection with HCV/
HIV, EtOH use, and family history)
Labs: CBC with diff, LFTs, PT/INR, hepatitis B serologies, HAV IgG antibody to
document immunity, and HIV screening
Evaluation of other causes of chronic liver disease: hepatitis C/D, iron & TIBV
levels (hemochromatosis)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening with AFP and ultrasound if high risk.
Consider liver biopsy for patients who meet criteria for chronic hepatitis. (HBsAg
positive for > 6 months, serum HBV DNA > 10 (5) copies/mL, persistent or
intermittent elevation in ALT/AST levels)
Co-infections
Hepatitis C (HCV): 10–15% of patients with chronic hepatitis B will have an
HCV infection. More common among drug abusers. Co-infection with hepatitis C
confers an increased risk of severe hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, as well as higher
rate of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatitis D (HDV): ONLY found in patients who are also infected with HBV.
More common in Mediterranean and parts of South America
Can occur in two forms
Co-infection of HBV and HDV: More severe acute hepatitis and higher
mortality but rarely develops into a chronic infection
Superinfection of HDV in an HBV carrier: Almost always becomes
chronic infection
There is a higher incidence of cirrhosis and HCC in chronic HBC/HDV co-
infection than those with chronic HBV infection alone
HIV: 6–13% of HIV patients also have chronic HBV infection
Patients with HIV have higher levels of HBV DNA and more severe liver
disease
If non-immune, should receive hepatitis B vaccine when the CD4 counts are
> 200
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
The longer the duration of disease in HBsAg positive patients, the greater the risk
for HCC
High risk groups for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma include men
older than 45 years, patients with cirrhosis, and patients with a positive family
history
Screening: Ultrasound every 6–12 months and α-fetoprotein (AFP) alone if
ultrasound not available or cost is a concern. May use both AFP and ultrasound
together
Cirrhosis
Risk factors include older age, high levels of HBV DNA, habitual alcohol
consumption, HCV/HDV/HIV infections, smoking, and exposure to carcinogens
142
ID
Also address alcohol use, sexual practices, and smoking history for risk factor
modifications to decrease risk of progression to cirrhosis
MEDICATIONS: Indicated for patients with active viral replication (positive HBeAg and
HBV DNA) and chronic hepatitis (elevated aminotransferases)
Interferon-α (Standard interferon and Peginterferon-α). Has anti-viral, anti-proliferative,
and immunomodulator activity. Mechanism of action is activation of intracellular enzymes
resulting in the degradation of HBV mRNA. Also, it augments expression of HLA class
I antigen-presenting molecules on the surfaces of infected hepatocytes thus boosting
cell-mediated immune response to HBV. Common side-effects are flu-like symptoms,
including fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and fatigue. Can lead to flare up in ALT levels
which can indicate a favorable response, but can also lead to hepatic decompensation,
especially in patients with underlying cirrhosis. Potential life threatening side-effects
neuropsychiatric (depression, suicidal ideation), autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious
disorders
Nucleotide analogue (Lamivudine, Adefovir, Entecavir, and Tenofovir). Suppresses viral
activity. Mechanism of action is acting as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor which inhibits
HBV as HBV is replicated by a reverse transcriptase enzyme. Also, it incorporates itself
into viral DNA resulting in DNA chain termination. Common side-effects are headache,
fatigue, elevation of ALT/AST and elevated bilirubin. Rarer but more serious side-effects
include lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly with steatosis, and HBV exacerbation post-treatment
PREVENTION OF PERINATAL HBV TRANSMISSION
Identification of HBV-infected pregnant women
All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg within first trimester of EACH
pregnancy, even if tested before or had hepatitis B vaccines
All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be tested for HBV DNA to guide the use
of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal HBV
transmission (new recommendation)
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases suggests maternal antiviral
therapy when the maternal HBV DNA is > 200,000 IU/mL (new recommendation)
All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be referred to their jurisdiction’s Perinatal
Hepatitis B Prevention Program for case management
Women not tested prenatally should be tested at the time of admission for delivery
Management of infants born to HBsAg-positive mother
All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive HepB vaccine and Hepatitis
B Immune Globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth, at separate injection sites. Only
single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the first dose
Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not
available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exits should be
managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation)
For infants weighing < 2,000 grams, the birth dose (i.e., the initial HepB vaccine dose)
should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced
immunogenicity of HepB vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for
a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1
month. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks
(164 days)
HEPATITIS B IMMUNE GLOBULIN (HBIG)
Indications
Newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mother
Dose: 0.5 mL HBIG IM within 12 hours of birth, along with 1st dose of HepB
vaccine concurrently at a separate site.
Infants < 2000g and mother’s HBsAg is unknown
Give HepB vaccine and 0.5mL HBIG within 12 hours of birth
In infants ≥2,000g and mother’s HBIG is unknown
143
ID
Give HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth, regardless of birth weight
If mother is determined to be HBsAg-positive, give 0.5mL of HBIG as soon as
possible, but no later than 7 days of age
Acute exposure to blood containing HBsAg via parenteral (needle stick, sharps, bite),
direct mucous membrane contact (accidental splash), or oral ingestion
Sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive person
Household exposure to person with acute HBV
Dose for acute, sexual, and household exposure: 0.06mL/kg IM ASAP or within 7
days of exposure
Give Hepatitis B vaccine series if unvaccinated
HEPATITIS B VACCINE (HepB VACCINE)
Indications
Newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mother or maternal HBsAg status unknown
Give 1st dose of HepB vaccine concurrently with HBIG at a separate site within
12 hours of birth
For infants ≥2,000g, 2nd HepB vaccine should be given at age 1 or 2 months and
3rd dose at age 6 months
For infants < 2,000g, 2nd dose should be given at age 1 months, 3rd dose at age
2–3 months, and 4th dose at age 6 months
The final dose of the vaccine series should not be administered before age 24
weeks (164 days)
Perform post-vaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg after
completion of the vaccine series at age 9–12 months
HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10mIU/mL should be revaccinated
with a single dose HepB vaccine and receive post-vaccination serologic
testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation)
Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10mIU/mL following single dose
revaccination should receive 2 additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete
the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1‒2 months
after the final dose
Available data do not suggest a benefit from additional HepB vaccine doses
to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥10mIU/mL following receipt of 2
complete HepB vaccine series
Universal childhood vaccination
3-dose series: 1st dose should be given within 24 hours of birth for medically
stable infants ≥2,000g (new recommendation). The 2nd and 3rd doses should be
given at age 1–2 and 6–18 months respectively
For infants < 2,000g, give the 1st dose at hospital discharge or age 1 month, the
2nd dose at age 2 months, and 3rd dose at age 6–18 months
If the vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccine series does not need to be
restarted. Administer the 2nd dose 1 to 2 months after the 1st dose (minimum
interval of 4 weeks), and the 3rd dose at least 8 weeks after the 2nd dose AND at
least 16 weeks after the 1st dose
The final dose should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks
Vaccinate children and adolescents aged < 19 years who have not been vaccinated
previously
Catch-up vaccination
3-dose series at 0, 1–2, and 6 months
Adolescents 11–15 years of age may use an alternative 2-dose schedule, with at
least 4 months between doses (adult formulation Recombivax HB only)
Selected patients and contacts (hemodialysis, hemophilia, hepatitis C, etc.), persons
at increased risk due to sexual practices or IV drug use, traveler (> 6 months-old) to
endemic regions, and natives of Alaska/Asia/Pacific Islands
Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends HepB vaccine
also be given to all unvaccinated adults with diabetes mellitus ages 19–59 years
144
ID
Health care workers/trainees: ACIP recommendations include pre-vaccination
serologic testing for previous infection regardless of vaccination status, post-
vaccination testing for higher risk practitioners. Should get another 3-dose series of
vaccine if anti-HBs concentration is < 10mlU/mL with repeat serologic testing 1–2
months after 3rd dose
Post-vaccination serologic testing
Post-vaccination testing should also be performed in chronic hemodialysis patients and
in infants of HBsAg-positive mother at 9–12 months of age
Hemodialysis patients should be screened yearly and if anti-HBs concentration is < 10
mlU/mL then booster dose of vaccine should be given. Dose: Give as IM injection
HEPATITIS A VACCINE (HepA VACCINE)
Indications:
Routine childhood vaccination
Current recommendation by the ACIP is that all persons with chronic liver disease in
the U.S. be vaccinated against hepatitis A
Dose: give as IM injection
SCREENING
Testing with HBsAg and HBsAb should be performed on the following patients
Persons born in endemic areas: Asia, Africa, Pacific islands, etc.
Unvaccinated children whose parents are from endemic regions
Patients with chronically elevated aminotransferases
Patients on immunosuppressive therapy or on dialysis
Men who have sex with men, multiple sexual partners, or history of sexually
transmitted infections
Inmates of correctional facilities
IV drug abusers
History of HIV or hepatitis C
All pregnant women
Family members, household and sexual contacts of infected individuals
CLINICAL PEARLS
Mortality rate with acute hepatitis B is 0.1–1%. It is higher with superimposed hepatitis D
Risk of chronic infection in a neonate is 90% (when transmitted at the time of delivery by
HBsAg positive mothers). They must receive the HB immune globulin, followed by the
vaccine series
HDV is a defective virus that only causes hepatitis in the presence of HBV infection. In
U.S., infection is primarily with IV drug users
There has been a 60% reduction in occupationally acquired hepatitis B infection due to
immunization programs
Hepatitis B vaccine series induces protective antibodies in 95% of healthy volunteers ages
20–39
Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increases 200–300 fold in patients with chronic
hepatitis B
