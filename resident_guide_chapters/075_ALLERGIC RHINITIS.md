75. ALLERGIC RHINITIS/SEASONAL ALLERGIES
OVERVIEW
Allergic rhinitis is an immunologically-mediated disease. It is initiated by a type I
antigen-antibody reaction. Inhaled allergens interact with T and B cell lymphocytes to
produce IgE antibodies which then attach to mast cells and basophils resulting in the
release of histamine and chemotactic factors and allergic rhinitis symptoms
Common, affects 10–30% of adults and up to 40% of children. Annual estimates of direct
medical costs of treating allergic rhinitis is up to $4.5 billion
Guidelines from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters in Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology defines rhinitis as “inflammation of the membranes lining the nose, and
is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching of the nose and/or
postnasal drainage.” Rhinitis is characterized by 1 or more of the following symptoms:
nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing and itching
Allergic rhinitis is associated with headaches, fatigue, poor concentration, loss of sleep,
fatigue, adverse effects of medical therapies and possible development of other medical
conditions such as asthma, sinusitis or otitis media
Rhinitis may be caused by allergic, non-allergic, infectious, hormonal, occupational or
other factors
HISTORY
Seasonal prevalence
Paroxysmal sneezing, rhinitis, dry, watery or pruritic eyes, pharyngeal itch, cough
Triggering exposures
Anosmia (decreased sense of smell)
Age at onset
Medication use (inquire specifically about intranasal decongestants, also See list below,
VI. B.)
History of atopy
Family history of allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and mucociliary dysfunction
disorders, inflammatory/autoimmune conditions
Surgical history of previous ENT operations
Social history should assess for exposures to tobacco or smog
PHYSICAL EXAM
Rhinorrhea and/or nasal congestion
Pale, boggy, blue-gray, edematous nasal turbinates which may be coated with clear
secretions
Nasal crease (“allergic salute”)
Infraorbital venous dilation (dark circles under eyes/allergic shiner)
Mouth breathing: Dry lips indicating mouth breathing as a result of impaired nasal
airflow
Skin folds under eyes (Denies lines)
Cobblestoning of posterior pharynx
Scleral/conjunctival injection and/or edema

LABS/TESTING
Percutaneous testing (prick testing): Small amount of antigen is pricked into the skin;
can easily be done in office if supply of antigens is available. Preferred for initial testing
because more rapid, less painful, less expensive, and less likely to cause systemic reactions
Intradermal testing: Antigen is injected into the dermis. Greater reproducibility and
greater sensitivity than prick testing. Higher false positive rate than prick testing
RAST (radioallergosorbent testing): Blood is analyzed for specific anti-IgE antibodies
to known antigens; useful for patients with extensive eczema, dermatographism or prior
anaphylaxis, young, or cannot discontinue antihistamines
Nasal smears: Eosinophilia can be supportive but is not diagnostic
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: May mimic symptoms of allergic rhinitis
Vasomotor rhinitis: Related to autonomic dysfunction and more common in women
Infectious rhinitis: Viral (up to 98% of acute rhinitis, especially in children), bacterial
Rhinitis medicamentosa: Tachyphylaxis after use of nasal decongestant or cocaine. Nasal
mucosa bright red and swollen
Eosinophilia syndrome: Nasal eosinophils in patients who have perennial symptoms and
occasionally loss of sense of smell
Hormonal rhinitis: Menstrual, pregnancy (usually second trimester to term, resolving
after delivery) and hypothyroidism
Drug-induced rhinitis: ACEI, PDE-5i, Aspirin, Clonidine, Hydralazine, Labetalol,
Propranolol, Methyldopa, Prazosin, Terazosin, Reserpine, NSAIDS, oral contraceptives
Gustatory rhinitis: Occupational—grain, dusts, irritants, chemicals; can be allergic/
mixed
Anatomic: Nasal polyps (often unilateral and associated with asthma and aspirin
sensitivity), septal deviation, tumors, hypertrophy of adenoids or nasal turbinates
Ciliary dysfunction: Primary (Kartagener’s syndrome, cystic fibrosis) secondary (viral)
Atrophic: caused by continuous nasal hygiene, lavage, and debridement
Other: Alcoholism, cocaine abuse, nasal septal deviation, tumors, adenoidal hypertrophy,
hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates
MANAGEMENT
Environmental controls
Indoor: Avoid active and passive tobacco smoke, remove bedroom carpet, foam
pillows, enclose mattress and box springs in plastic, use air conditioning
Dust mites: Control bedroom: wash bedding weekly, impermeable covers on pillows
and mattresses, keep humidity below 50%, HEPA (high density particulate air) filter
Molds: Remove any visible mold/mildew, treat with a retardant, frost-free refrigera-
tor, keep firewood outside, avoid house-plants, clean heating and cooling systems,
remove old books
Animals: Avoid furry animals and birds or eliminate carpeting and keep floors polished
and upholstery frequently cleaned, HEPA vacuum. Animals should stay out of the
bedroom
Pharmacotherapy
Intranasal medications: Often helpful in conjunction with oral antihistamines
Intranasal corticosteroids: First line treatment. Intranasal steroids onset of effect
is within 24 hours, but maximal effect is not for a few weeks. Ciclesonide and
Fluticasone Furoate have less than 1% systemic bioavailability and are less likely
to have systemic effects than older intranasal steroids
Several options to choose from, many now available over the counter
Intranasal anticholinergic: Ipratropium (Atrovent Intranasal 0.03%, 0.06%): useful
in treatment of anterior watery rhinorrhea. Dose 2 sprays per nostril 3–4 ×/day
Intranasal antihistamine: Azelastine (Astelin), Olopatadine (Patanase): 2 sprays
each nostril BID
342
GEN
Mast cell stabilizers: Cromolyn Sodium (NasalCrom): 1 spray each nostril 3–6 ×/
day
Saline nasal spray: Safe, inexpensive, helps thin mucous, use 3–6 ×/day, e.g.,
Saline X, Ocean Nasal Mist, NaSal
Nasal vasoconstrictors: Should not use more than 3–4 days secondary to rebound
vasodilatation and worsening of symptoms (Rhinitis medicamentosa). May be
helpful in acute sinusitis or for airplane flights
Neo-Synephrine (Phenylephrine): 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0%: 2–3 sprays in each nostril
every 4 hours PRN
Oxymetazoline (Afrin): 2–3 sprays each nostril BID; do not use for more than
3 days

Immunotherapy
Indications
Unable to manage symptoms with environmental modification or medications
Patients who require medications for greater than 6 months of the year
Intolerable side-effects to medications
Caution in initiating injection immunotherapy in children < 5 years
Perform RAST testing or skin testing to identify the offending allergen
Weekly injections are initiated with a small amount of antigen, which is gradually
increased. Length of time between injections is also gradually increased to once every
3–4 weeks
Often able to discontinue after 3–5 seasons and have persisting benefit for several
years after completion of therapy
CLINICAL PEARLS
It may often be helpful with copious rhinitis to give an oral decongestant
(Pseudoephedrine, Phenylephrine) along with an antihistamine and intranasal treatments
Allergic rhinitis symptoms may worsen during pregnancy
Intranasal medications are more effective if patient blows nose before using
Onset of allergic rhinitis is before age 30 in 70% of patients
Pharmacotherapy is much more effective when used at the onset of symptoms or before
symptoms begin
Therapy for rhinitis medicamentosa involves weaning the intranasal decongestant over 1
week and combining with oral steroids (0.5–1.0mg/kg/day) tapered over 7–10 days
Cystic fibrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in children with nasal
polyps
The FDA panel recommends OTC cold medicines should not be used in children < 2 years
of age because of risks of potentially life-threatening side-effects. The FDA has not yet
reviewed information that OTC cold medicines should not be used in patients between the
ages of 2–11
