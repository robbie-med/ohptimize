23. QUESTIONS EXPECTING PARENTS COMMONLY
ASK AND RADIATION IN PREGNANCY
These issues include anticipatory guidance to give to the pregnant patient
WHAT TO EXPECT DURING PRENATAL VISITS? Assuming that patients present early
in pregnancy
First visit (often first visit is with nursing staff)
Calculation of due date
Medical history
Prenatal labs (CBC, Blood type, HIV, Rubella and Varicella titers, RPR, Chlamydia,
Hep B Ag) and urine culture
Prescription for prenatal vitamins
Second visit
Pelvic Exam/Pap
Gonorrhea/Chlamydia culture
Possible ultrasound
Each subsequent visit
Calculate gestational age
Weight/Blood pressure
Check urine for protein and glucose
Fetal Heart tones
Glucose tolerance test at 24–28 weeks
Check cervical dilation & effacement after 34 weeks
Group B Strep testing between 35–37 weeks
Frequency of visits (normal pregnancy)
Every 4–6 weeks through 20 weeks
Every 3–4 weeks, weeks 20–28
Every 2–3 weeks, weeks 28–36
Every week, week 36-delivery
Additional genetic testing for gender, neural tube defects, and chromosomal anomalies
can be performed after discussion with parents based on their risk factors, along with
the risks and benefits of each test. The intent of such screening and diagnosis is to
enable pregnant women to make informed decisions regarding the pregnancy and be
better prepared in the event of the birth of an affected infant
HOW MUCH WEIGHT TO GAIN?
Recommended weight gain during pregnancy goes as follows:
Normal weight
25–35lbs
Underweight
28–40lbs
Overweight
15–25lbs
Obese
15lbs
Carrying twins
35–45lbs
Expect to gain 1 pound per week between 20–40 weeks
WHAT TO EAT? WHAT SHOULD I AVOID? DIETARY GUIDELINES
Artificial sweeteners: Avoid or minimize intake
Preferred Sweeteners: Aspartame (Equal or NutraSweet) or Sucralose (Splenda)
87
OB-GYN
Avoid Saccharin (commonly found in Sweet-n-Low, some diet sodas/chewing gum) as
it is known to cross the placenta and may remain in fetal tissue
Caffeine: Limit consumption to 300mg (2 servings) per day
Observational studies showed an association between high caffeine consumption and
spontaneous abortion/low birth weight as well as caffeine withdrawal in newborns
Dairy: Great source of calcium but avoid unpasteurized products and soft cheeses (i.e.,
Brie, Camembert, blue cheese) due to risk of Toxoplasma and Listeria contamination
Eggs: Avoid raw eggs (i.e., Caesar salad, eggnog, and raw cookie dough) due to increased
risk of salmonella contamination
Folic acid: Supplementation should be initiated as soon as possible (400mcg daily) to
prevent neural tube defects. Woman taking folic acid antagonist should take 4mg of folic
acid daily
Fruits and vegetables: Ensure proper cleaning of all fresh produce due to risk of
Toxoplasma and Listeria contamination
Leftover food: Thoroughly reheat before eating to reduce risk of Listeria contamination.
Meats: Avoid undercooked meat; hotdogs and cold cuts should be heated until steaming
hot due to risk of Toxoplasma and Listeria contamination
Nitrates found in cured meats and hot dogs: Avoid or limit intake. Most grocery stores
offer nitrate free (preservative free) options at the deli counter
Seafood: Avoid shark, swordfish, mackerel, tilefish, and tuna steaks; limit intake of other
fish (including canned tuna) to 12 oz per week. Exposure to high levels of mercury in
certain fish can lead to neurological abnormalities in pregnant women and infants. Avoid
raw fish and shellfish due to risk of exposure to parasites and Norovirus. For a listing of
mercury levels in fish visit the Environmental Protection Agency’s Fish Advisory website:
https://www.epa.gov/fish-tech/epa-fda-advice-about-eating-fish-and-shellfish
WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE SAFE TO PARTICIPATE IN?
Pregnant women may have sexual intercourse, drive a car, fly in an airplane (however
traveling far distances is not recommended at the end of third trimester—See Sec. IX below),
go swimming, take tub baths and paint the nursery. Exercise is safe and encouraged during
normal, uncomplicated pregnancies. Adequate rest, exercise and nutrition are advisable for
the best pregnancy outcomes
WHAT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE AVOIDED?
Douching, cleaning the litter-box, dieting to lose weight, high risk activities (skiing,
skydiving – absolutely NO scuba diving), new vigorous exercise programs, high impact
aerobics, roller coasters, saunas and hot tubs (especially 1st trimester as heat exposure during
early pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects), tanning booths
HOW TO HANDLE COMMON SYMPTOMS, DISCOMFORTS AND ILLNESSES?
Constipation: Common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and functional
compression of major digestive organs as baby becomes bigger. Recommend increased
water intake and fiber (20–35 g daily from sources such as whole grains, leafy green
vegetables, beans, apples, pears, prunes and nuts) along with exercise to promote healthy
digestion. Preventing constipation may decrease risk for hemorrhoids. May also try
Metamucil, Citrucel, Fibercon, Milk of Magnesia
Dental problems/concerns: Teeth cleaning and plaque control are considered safe. Okay
to have x-rays with use of lead abdominal shield. Local anesthetic agents such as Novocain
safe but AVOID nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”)
Fatigue: Especially common during first trimester. Recommend at least 8 hours of rest per
night and naps during the day but long naps will affect patient’s ability to sleep at night.
Have patient rest on left side to promote healthy blood flow to baby and kidneys
Frequent urination: Most common during first and third trimester as the uterus expands
and places pressure on the bladder. Do NOT limit water intake
88
OB-GYN
History of herpes or active herpes: The American Academy of Pediatrics and the
American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommend prophylactic treatment of
herpes starting at 36 weeks gestation or treatment for active herpes with antiviral drug
Acyclovir (limited data on prenatal exposure to Valacyclovir and Famciclovir).
Nausea/vomiting (“morning sickness”)
Most frequent during first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Often called “morning sickness”
but can occur at any time throughout the day. Recommendations: Eat toast or crackers
before getting out of bed, get up slowly and wait on the edge of bed for a few minutes,
eat 5–6 small meals per day, don’t let stomach get empty, avoid unpleasant smells, eat
whatever sounds good, avoid spicy/greasy foods or high acid foods, drink carbonated
beverages, change brand of toothpaste
If symptoms don’t resolve with the above recommendations then try: Vitamin B6
25mg BID (FIRST-LINE therapy), doxylamine (Unisom—may cause drowsiness)
25mg BID, ranitidine (Zantac) 75mg BID or famotidine (Pepcid AC) 10mg BID.
Prescriptions such as doxylamine/ pyridoxine (Diclegis) and ondansetron (Zofran) can
also provide relief
Leg cramps: Common in last trimester of pregnancy. Recommend increased fluids,
calcium, potassium and stretching your legs throughout the day
Low back pain: Recommend wearing comfortable shoes and using a good posture. Avoid
high-heeled shoes and overly soft beds/chairs. Pregnancy support belt may also be helpful.
Exercise, especially stretching, will relieve backache more than anything else
Pelvic pain: During 1st trimester patients may experience menstrual-like cramps due to
the uterus growing and moving up in the pelvis. Round ligament pain is the stretching or
spasms of the ligaments that support the uterus. Round ligament pain can be aggravated
by sudden movements like rolling in bed or prolonged walking. Massaging the area and
applying heat may be helpful
Viral exposures
Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Most common congenital viral infection. CMV primarily
affects the intracranial ventricles, the organ of Corti and the neurons of the eighth
cranial nerve, which explains why it is the leading cause of congenital hearing loss.
CMV can also cause seizures, petechial rash and the classic “blueberry muffin rash.”
The rate of fetal transmission increases with advancing gestation, but the severity of
disease is inversely related. Though newborns may be asymptomatic at birth, they may
develop neurodevelopmental damage within the first three years of life
Fifth Disease (“slapped cheek”): Does not cause birth defects but can cause
miscarriage and anemia. Draw Parvovirus titers
HIV: Universal antenatal HIV testing. For women with HIV, counseling, maternal
antiretroviral medication, neonatal postexposure prophylaxis, delivery by caesarean
section prior to onset of labor, and discouraging breastfeeding are recommended.
These have decreased mother-to-infant transmission to less than 1% in the United
States. Exact mechanism of transmission is unknown but greatest risk is associated
with advanced maternal disease, likely due to high maternal HIV viral load
Hepatitis: Acute viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy
Hepatitis A: Vertical transmission during pregnancy or peripartum is rare. Pregnancy
should not impact physicians management of infection
Hepatitis B: Acute infection during pregnancy is usually mild and not associated with
teratogenicity or mortality. Treatment is mainly supportive with monitoring of liver
function and prothrombin time. Antiviral therapy unnecessary unless patient has acute
liver failure
Hepatitis C: Women chronically infected with hepatitis C typically have uneventful
pregnancies; vertical transmission is the greatest concern. Mechanism of transmission
is poorly understood, overall, the rate appears to be less than 2% when adjusted for
certain clinical variables (co-infection with HIV 19% transmission rate). Pregnant
women should be seen regularly by a gastroenterologist to monitor liver function and
viral load. During labor, prolonged rupture of membranes should be avoided, as well
as invasive obstetric procedures. Caesarean delivery should be reserved for the usual

obstetrical indications. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV): Primary infection during pregnancy is associated with
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, and congenital
and neonatal herpes infections. Primary infection late in pregnancy carries 30–50%
risk of neonatal infection, while early in pregnancy is less than 1%. Mothers with
prior HSV infection can be given suppressive antiviral therapy during last month
of pregnancy to reduce transmission. However, if lesions or prodromal symptoms
are present at the onset of labor, caesarean section is recommended even if patient
received suppressive therapy
Neonatal herpes infection classified into three categories: localized skin,
eye, and mouth (SEM); central nervous system (CNS) with or without SEM;
and disseminated disease (which carries a mortality rate in excess of 80% if
untreated). Infected newborns can exhibit significant neurologic deficits, temporal
encephalitis, blindness, seizures, and learning disabilities
Influenza: More likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women (and up to 2 weeks
postpartum) than in women who are not pregnant, leading to hospitalizations and even
death. Pregnant women with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for
their developing baby, including premature labor and delivery
Rubella: When maternal infection occurs in first trimester, fetal infection rates are up
to 50%, then drop to < 1% after 12 weeks. Diagnosis of primary maternal infection
should be made by serologic tests. Pregnancy outcomes as a result of maternal
rubella infection include spontaneous abortion, fetal infection, stillbirths, fetal growth
restriction and congenital rubella syndrome. Peripartum maternal infection does not
seem to increase the risk of congenital rubella syndrome
Varicella: No concern if patient had vaccine or prior exposure. However, primary
varicella infection during pregnancy is associated with significant maternal and
fetal morbidity and mortality. Approximately 10–20% of pregnant women who are
infected with varicella will develop pneumonia, which carries a mortality rate of up
to 40%. Fetal morbidity and mortality is related to the development of congenital
varicella syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by limb hypoplasia, microcephaly,
hydrocephaly, cataracts, intrauterine growth restriction, and mental retardation
Zika virus: Until more is known, CDC recommends special precaution for pregnant
women to prevent exposure and risk for birth defects (microcephaly). If a pregnant
woman must travel, it is recommended to take steps to plan for travel (refer to CDC
website on traveler’s information). If a patient’s sex partner travels to a high risk Zika
virus area, condoms are recommended to protect from exposure to Zika
Vaccines: All women should receive Tdap during EACH pregnancy between 27–36
weeks gestation. Recommend influenza vaccination at any gestational age (only injectable,
AVOID intranasal). Avoid any live attenuated vaccines (such as MMR or Varicella)
WHAT MEDICATIONS ARE SAFE TO USE DURING PREGNANCY?
For general guidance, refer to Chapter 22, Medication During Pregnancy and Lactation
WHICH DANGER SIGNS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED?
Bleeding (more than a few spots) from the vagina
A sudden gush of fluid or a slow leak of fluid
Severe or continuous headache
Dizziness, blurring or changes in vision
Persistent nausea and/or vomiting; unable to tolerate food or fluids > 24 hours
Severe abdominal pain
Chills and fever over 101°F
Fainting
Pain or burning with urination
Unusual vaginal discharge with discoloration or odor
Unilateral leg pain and swelling
90
OB-GYN
Chest pain and shortness of breath
Decreased or no fetal movement for greater than 12 hours after 21 weeks of gestation
WHAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR TRAVEL?
Recommend patients always wear three-point harness seat belts when driving
Pregnant patients are at increased risk for blood clots. Avoid long trips when possible or
suggest patient stops frequently to walk and stretch legs
Patients may travel up to the 35th week of pregnancy unless they have risks factors
such as history of premature labor or premature rupture of membranes. Each patient to
be evaluated individually based on her risk factors and current symptoms
When patient travels, advise her to be familiar with the hospital and medical resources
within the region she is traveling. Provide patients with a copy of their prenatal records
prior to travel
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information for pregnant
travelers: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pregnant-travelers
ARE X-RAYS SAFE IN PREGNANCY?
There is always a risk vs. benefit in medical testing and therapies. The most sensitive
time of central nervous system development is 10–17 weeks and routine testing should
be delayed until after this time. Generally, an x-ray is safe as there is only a very small
amount of radiation exposure to the fetus. It is recommended the unborn children not be
exposed to more than 5.0 rads during the pregnancy. As reference point, the amount of
radiation in a 2 view chest x-ray is 0.00007 rads. Avoid direct x-ray exposure to abdomen
