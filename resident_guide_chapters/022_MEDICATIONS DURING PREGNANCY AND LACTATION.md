22. MEDICATIONS DURING PREGNANCY
AND LACTATION
—PART ONE: MEDICATION USE DURING PREGNANCY—
INTRODUCTION
Drugs that can cause birth defects are commonly prescribed to women of reproductive
age
Approximately 50% of pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned
Major malformations in the general population: 2–3%. Among the major malformations,
drug exposure accounts for 2–3%
A study by Mitchell, et al. found 50% of pregnant women reported taking at least one
medication and an average of 2.6 medications was used at any time during pregnancy
FACTORS INFLUENCING TERATOGENICITY OF DRUGS
Dose reaching the fetus
Gestational age (GA) at exposure
0–2 weeks GA: Highest risk of spontaneous abortion
4–10 weeks GA is the most vulnerable period of risk for major congenital
malformations
14+ weeks GA: Growth, physiologic functioning, reproduction, neurological and
mental development
Duration of exposure
Specificity of the agent
Maternal and fetal genotypes
Other simultaneous exposures (other drugs or environmental agent: e.g., mercury
in polluted fish, maternal folate level)
GENERAL APPROACH TO MEDICATION USE DURING PREGNANCY
Many drugs with systemic effects in the mother will cross the placenta and their effects on
the fetus are not known
Data on drug safety in pregnant women is very limited; < 10% of medications have
enough safety data from FDA; benefits must outweigh risks
Psychiatric or seizure disorders frequently require drug therapy throughout pregnancy.
In such patients, care must be taken to select the safest drug from the necessary class of
medication
Effective communication is essential for the clinicians to engage patients in shared
decision-making on the risks and benefits of medications that can cause birth defects
FDA Pregnancy and lactation labeling for prescription drugs
In 2015, the FDA began phasing out the Pregnancy Letter categories (A, B, C, D, and X)
from drug labeling because they are often viewed as confusing and overly simplistic
The new pregnancy and lactation labeling requires manufacturers to include clinically
relevant information from well-conducted studies about use of their drug during pregnancy
and breastfeeding, as well as data collected from pregnancy exposure registries

—PART TWO: MEDICATION USE IN BREASTFEEDING MOTHER—
INTRODUCTION
There are many benefits to breastfeeding, See Chapter 4, Infant Formula and
Breastfeeding
Many mothers need to use medications during breastfeeding
All drugs transfer into breast milk to some degree and this may pose a risk to the breast-
fed infant
FACTORS DETERMINING DRUG EXPOSURE TO THE BREAST-FED INFANT
Maternal drug plasma level
Drug properties: protein binding, lipid solubility, ionization
Infant’s drug exposure
Drug’s concentration in the breast milk
Amount of breast milk consumed by the infant
Infants have lower drug clearance than adults
Increased drug transfer in pre-term infants and infants with significant illness
GENERAL APPROACH TO MEDICATION USE IN A NURSING WOMAN
Avoid maternal drug therapy if possible
Use topical therapy when possible
Select medications that are safe for use and are well-studied in infants
Select drugs with the shortest half-life, highest protein-binding, and lowest lipid solubility
to minimize drug transfer to breast milk
WAYS TO MINIMIZE RISK TO THE BREAST-FED INFANT FROM MATERNAL
MEDICATIONS
Reduce infant’s drug exposure
Administer once-daily medication just before the longest sleep interval for the infant,
usually after the bedtime feeding
Breastfeed the infant immediately prior to a dose as concentrations in milk are likely to
be lowest at the end of a dosing interval
Assess plasma concentration of the drug in the infant if needed. The drug is considered
“safe” if an infant dose is close to 1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose
If the drug is not considered safe in breastfeeding, breast milk may be expressed and
discarded for the treatment duration. Breastfeeding may be resumed after the drug has
been eliminated from the maternal blood stream (approximately 4–5 half-lives of the
drug)
Monitor effects of the drug in the infant
Monitor the infant for adverse effects such as failure to thrive, irritability and sedation
Hemolysis may occur even at a very low concentration of certain drugs in an infant
with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency

CLINICAL PEARLS
Consider a non-drug modality first if possible when treating a woman who is pregnant
Avoid prescribing a medication during the first trimester if possible
When the benefit of a medication is felt to outweigh potential risks, use the lowest effective
dose of the drug with the most data on safety in pregnancy
Prefer older medications with good safety records to newer drugs with less supporting data
Provide effective contraception to women taking potentially teratogenic medications who
do not desire pregnancy
Careful consideration is necessary for drugs that are concentrated in human milk or result
in significant exposure in the infant
