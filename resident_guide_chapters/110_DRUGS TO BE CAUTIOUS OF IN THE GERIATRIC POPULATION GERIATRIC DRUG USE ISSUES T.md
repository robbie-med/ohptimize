110. DRUGS TO BE CAUTIOUS OF IN THE
GERIATRIC POPULATION
GERIATRIC DRUG USE ISSUES
Though the elderly make up only 13% of the population, they account for one-third of all
prescribed medications in the U.S.
The average home-dwelling elder has at least 4 different prescriptions, while a nursing
home resident averages 7 prescriptions
Polypharmacy and age-related physiological changes contribute to the increased
incidence of adverse drug events and nonadherence in the elderly population
Approximately 30% of hospital admissions in elderly patients may be linked to drug-
related problems including toxic effects and/or interactions. Subtle but important side
effects such as sedation or cognitive impairment resulting in falls may go unrecognized
EFFECTS OF AGING ON PHARMACOTHERAPY
Altered absorption: Drug absorption may decrease as a result of low acid production
(e.g., Ketoconazole)
Changes in drug distribution
Elderly persons have more body fat, less total body water and lean body mass than
younger adults. Therefore, lipid-soluble drugs (e.g., Diazepam) will have increased
body store and hence prolonged effects. On the other hand, water-soluble drugs (e.g.,
Cimetidine and Lithium) and drugs bound to muscle (e.g., Digoxin) will have higher
serum concentrations and hence increased toxicity
Serum albumin concentration often declines, especially in frail elderly. Drugs that are
highly protein-bound (e.g., Phenytoin, Warfarin) will have increased pharmacologic
action because there will be more drug available in free (active) form
Drug clearance and aging
Hepatic metabolism of certain drugs may diminish with age. Drugs that undergo Phase
I metabolism (e.g., Diazepam, Alprazolam) will have prolonged activity
Renal elimination of drugs decreases with age, as renal function declines by
approximately 10% each decade after age 40. Serum creatinine may overestimate renal
function in the elderly due to decreased muscle mass. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is
a more useful measurement of renal function. Drugs that depend on renal elimination
(e.g., aminoglycosides, quinolones, Digoxin, H2 blockers) will require dosage
adjustment according to CrCl
Pharmacodynamics: Older patients appear to be more sensitive to benzodiazepines,
opiates, warfarin, and agents with anticholinergic side-effects. The apparent increase in
receptor sensitivity can result in greater therapeutic effect as well as an increased potential
for toxicity
RECOGNIZING AND PREVENTING ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS
Adverse drug reactions may mimic the characteristics of disease states. Drug-induced
cognitive impairment may be mistaken for senile dementia and may increase risk of falls.
Drugs with strong anticholinergic properties can cause dry mouth, constipation, confusion,
and urinary retention
The susceptibility of older persons to adverse drug reactions can be assessed by
determining the risk associated with specific drugs
Use the acronym MASTER developed by Garnett and Barr as a guide for rational drug
therapy in the elderly

GERI
M – Minimize number of drugs used and simplify medication schedules. Discontinue
drug whenever possible
A – Alternatives should be considered. Avoid drugs that pose high risk to older persons.
Select the most cost-effective alternative
S – Start low, go slow. Start at the lowest possible dosage and increase slowly
T – Titrate the dose according to response. Monitor plasma levels if applicable. Monitor
patients for adverse reactions
E – Educate patients about their drug therapy and their potential side-effects. Be
aware of visual, hearing and memory impairment and adjust instruction accordingly.
Encourage and routinely check for adherence
R – Review regularly patient’s medications, including OTC products and home
remedies. Assess for drug-disease and drug-drug interactions
Routine application of tools such as STOPP (screening tool of older persons’ potentially
inappropriate prescriptions) criteria and START (screening tool to alert doctors to right
treatment) criteria may lead to meaningful clinical benefits
COMMONLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS REQUIRING SPECIAL
CONSIDERATIONS
The Beers criteria is the most commonly used criteria used by physicians to prevent
adverse drug events in elder adults.

Organ System, Therapeutic Category,
Drug(s)
Recommendation, Rationale: Quality of
Evidence (QE), Strength of Recommendation
(SR)
Anticholinergics*
First-generation
antihistamines:
■Brompheniramine
■Carbinoxamine
■Chlorpheniramine
■Clemastine
■Cyproheptadine
■Dexbrompheniramine
■Dexchlorpheniramine
■Dimenhydrinate
■Diphenhydramine (oral)
■Doxylamine
■Hydroxyzine
■Meclizine
■Promethazine
■Pyrilamine
■Triprolidine
Avoid: Highly anticholinergic; clearance reduced with advanced
age, and tolerance develops when used as hypnotic; risk of
confusion, dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic
effects or toxicity
Use of diphenhydramine in situations such as acute treatment
of severe allergic reaction may be appropriate QE = Moderate;
SR = Strong
Antiparkinsonian agents
■Benztropine (oral)
■Trihexyphenidyl
Avoid: Not recommended for prevention of extrapyramidal
symptoms with antipsychotics; more effective agents available
for treatment of Parkinson disease QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Antithrombotics
■Dipyridamole, oral short-acting (does not apply to the
extended release combination with aspirin)
Avoid: Rationale: May cause orthostatic hypotension; more
effective alternatives available; IV form acceptable for use in
cardiac stress testing QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Anti-infective
■Nitrofurantoin
Avoid in individuals with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or
for long-term suppression: Potential for pulmonary toxicity,
hepatoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, especially with long-
term use; safer alternatives available
QE = Low; SR = Strong
499
GERI
Cardiovascular
Peripheral alpha-1 blockers for treatment of hypertension
■Doxazosin
■Prazosin
■Terazosin
Avoid use as an antihypertensive: High risk of orthostatic
hypotension and associated harms, especially in older adults; not
recommended as routine treatment for hypertension; alternative
agents have superior risk/benefit profile
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Central-alpha agonists
Clonidine for first-line
treatment of hypertension
Other CNS alpha-agonists
■Guanabenz
■Guanfacine
■Methyldopa
■Reserpine (>0.1 mg/d)
Avoid clonidine as first-line antihypertensive. Avoid other
CNS alpha-agonists as listed: High risk of adverse CNS
effects; may cause bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension; not
recommended as routine treatment for hypertension
QE = Low; SR = Strong
Disopyramide
Avoid: May induce heart failure in older adults because of
potent negative inotropic action; strongly anticholinergic; other
antiarrhythmic drugs preferred
QE = Low; SR = Strong
Dronedarone
Avoid in individuals with permanent atrial fibrillation or severe
or recently decompensated heart failure: Worse outcomes
have been reported in patients taking dronedarone who have
permanent atrial fibrillation or severe or recently decompensated
heart failure
QE = High; SR = Strong
Amiodarone
Avoid as first-line therapy for atrial fibrillation unless the
patient has heart failure or substantial left ventricular
hypertrophy: Effective for maintaining sinus rhythm but has
greater toxicities than other antiarrhythmics used in atrial
fibrillation; may be reasonable first-line therapy in patients
with concomitant heart failure or substantial left ventricular
hypertrophy if rhythm control is preferred over rate control
QE = High; SR = Strong
Nifedipine, immediate release
Avoid: Potential for hypotension; risk of precipitating
myocardial ischemia
QE = High; SR = Strong
Digoxin for first-line treatment of atrial fibrillation or of heart
failure
Avoid this rate control agent as first-line therapy for atrial
fibrillation. Avoid as first-line therapy for heart failure. If used
for atrial fibrillation or heart failure, avoid dosages >0.125
mg/d: Use in atrial fibrillation: should not be used as a first-line
agent in atrial fibrillation, because there are safer and more
effective alternatives for rate control supported by high-quality
evidence. Use in heart failure: evidence for benefits and harms
of digoxin is conflicting and of lower quality; most but not all of
the evidence concerns use in heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF). There is strong evidence for other agents
as first-line therapy to reduce hospitalizations and mortality
in adults with HFrEF. In heart failure, higher dosages are not
associated with additional benefit and may increase toxicity.
Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to increased risk
of toxic effects; further dose reduction may be necessary in those
with Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease.
QE = Atrial fibrillation: Low. Heart failure: Low. Dosage
>0.125 mg/d: Moderate; SR = Atrial fibrillation: Strong. Heart
failure: Strong. Dosage >0.125 mg/d: Strong
Central nervous system
Antidepressants, alone or in combination:
■Amitriptyline
■Amoxapine
■Clomipramine
■Desipramine
■Doxepin >6 mg/d
■Imipramine
■Nortriptyline
■Paroxetine
■Protriptyline
■Trimipramine
Avoid: Highly anticholinergic, sedating, and cause orthostatic
hypotension; safety profile of low-dose doxepin (≤6 mg/d)
comparable to that of placebo
QE = High; SR = Strong
(Chart continues on next page)
500
GERI
Antipsychotics, first-(conventional) and second- (atypical)
generation
Avoid, except in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or for
short-term use as antiemetic during chemotherapy: Increased
risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and greater rate of
cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia
Avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems of dementia or
delirium unless nonpharmacological options (e.g., behavioral
interventions) have failed or are not possible and the older adult
is threatening substantial harm to self or others
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Barbiturates
■Amobarbital
■Butabarbital
■Butalbital
■Mephobarbital
■Pentobarbital
■Phenobarbital
■Secobarbital
Avoid: High rate of physical dependence, tolerance to sleep
benefits, greater risk of overdose at low dosages
QE = High; SR = Strong
Benzodiazepines
Short- and intermediate acting:
■Alprazolam
■Estazolam
■Lorazepam
■Oxazepam
■Temazepam
■Triazolam
Long-acting:
■Chlordiazepoxide (alone or in combination
with amitriptyline or clidinium)
■Clonazepam
■Clorazepate
■Diazepam
■Flurazepam
■Quazepam
Avoid: Older adults have increased sensitivity to
benzodiazepines and decreased metabolism of long-acting
agents; in general, all benzodiazepines increase risk of cognitive
impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes
in older adults. May be appropriate for seizure disorders,
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, benzodiazepine
withdrawal, ethanol withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety
disorder, and periprocedural anesthesia
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Meprobamate
Avoid: High rate of physical dependence; sedating
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor
agonist hypnotics (i.e., “Z-drugs”)
■Eszopiclone
■Zaleplon
■Zolpidem
Avoid: Nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonist
hypnotics (i.e., “Z drugs”) have adverse events similar to
those of benzodiazepines in older adults (e.g., delirium, falls,
fractures); increased emergency room visits hospitalizations;
motor vehicle crashes; minimal improvement in sleep latency
and duration
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Ergoloid mesylates (dehydrogenated ergot alkaloids)
Isoxsuprine
Avoid: Lack of efficacy
QE = High; SR = Strong
Endocrine
Androgens
■Methyltestosterone
■Testosterone
Avoid unless indicated for confirmed hypogonadism
with clinical symptoms: Potential for cardiac problems;
contraindicated in men with prostate cancer
QE = Moderate; SR = Weak
Desiccated thyroid
Avoid: Concerns about cardiac effects; safer alternatives
available
QE = Low; SR = Strong
Growth hormone
Avoid, except for patients rigorously diagnosed by evidence-
based criteria with growth hormone deficiency due to an
established etiology: Impact on body composition is small and
associated with edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome,
gynecomastia, impaired fasting glucose
QE = High; SR = Strong
501
GERI
Estrogens with or without progestins
Avoid systemic estrogen (e.g., oral and topical patch).
Vaginal cream or vaginal tablets: acceptable to use low-
dose intravaginal estrogen for management of dyspareunia,
recurrent lower urinary tract infections, and other vaginal
symptoms: Evidence of carcinogenic potential (breast and
endometrium); lack of cardioprotective effect and cognitive
protection in older women.
Evidence indicates that vaginal estrogens for the treatment of
vaginal dryness are safe and effective; women with a history
of breast cancer who do not respond to nonhormonal therapies
are advised to discuss the risk and benefits of low-dose vaginal
estrogen (dosages of estradiol <25 mcg twice weekly) with their
healthcare provider
QE = Oral and patch: High. Vaginal cream or tablets:
Moderate; SR = Oral and patch: Strong. Topical vaginal cream
or tablets: Weak
Insulin, sliding scale (insulin regimens containing only short- or
rapid-acting insulin dosed according to current blood glucose
levels without concurrent use of basal or long-acting insulin)
Avoid: Higher risk of hypoglycemia without improvement
in hyperglycemia management regardless of care setting;
Avoid insulin regimens that include only short- or rapid-
acting insulin dosed according to current blood glucose levels
without concurrent use of basal or long-acting insulin. This
recommendation does not apply to regimens that contain basal
insulin or long-acting insulin.
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Megestrol
Avoid: Minimal effect on weight; increases risk of thrombotic
events and possibly death in older adults
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Sulfonylureas, long-acting
■Chlorpropamide
■Glimepiride
■Glyburide (also known as glibenclamide)
Avoid: Chlorpropamide: prolonged half-life in older adults; can
cause prolonged hypoglycemia; causes SIADH. Glimepiride
and Glyburide: higher risk of severe prolonged hypoglycemia
in older adults
QE = High; SR = Strong
Gastrointestinal
Metoclopramide
Avoid, unless for gastroparesis with duration of use not to
exceed 12 weeks except in rare cases: Can cause extrapyramidal
effects, including tardive dyskinesia; risk may be greater in frail
older adults and with prolonged exposure
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Mineral oil, given orally
Avoid: Potential for aspiration and adverse effects; safer
alternatives available
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Proton-pump inhibitors
Avoid scheduled use for >8 weeks unless for high-risk patients
(e.g., oral corticosteroids or chronic NSAID use), erosive
esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagitis, pathological hypersecretory
condition, or demonstrated need for maintenance treatment
(e.g., because of failure of drug discontinuation trial or H2-
receptor antagonists: Risk of C difficile infection and bone loss
and fractures
QE = High; SR = Strong
Pain medications
Meperidine
Avoid: Oral analgesic not effective in dosages commonly used;
may have higher risk of neurotoxicity, including delirium, than
other opioids; safer alternatives available
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
(Chart continues on next page)

GERI
Non-cyclooxygenase selective NSAIDs, oral:
■Aspirin >325mg/d
■Diclofenac
■Diflunisal
■Etodolac
■Fenoprofen
■Ibuprofen
■Ketoprofen
■Meclofenamate
■Mefenamic acid
■Meloxicam
■Nabumetone
■Naproxen
■Oxaprozin
■Piroxicam
■Sulindac
■Tolmetin
Avoid chronic use, unless other alternatives are not effective
and patient can take gastroprotective agent (proton-pump
inhibitor or misoprostol): Increased risk of gastrointestinal
bleeding or peptic ulcer disease in high-risk groups, including
those aged >75 or taking oral or parenteral corticosteroids,
anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents; use of proton-pump
inhibitor or misoprostol reduces but does not eliminate risk.
Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation
caused by NSAIDs occur in ~1% of patients treated for 3–6
months and in ~2–4% of patients treated for 1 year; these trends
continue with longer duration of use. Also can increase blood
pressure and induce kidney injury. Risks are dose-related. QE =
Moderate; SR = Strong
■Indomethacin
■Ketorolac, includes parenteral
Avoid: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding/peptic ulcer
disease, and acute kidney injury in older adults. Indomethacin is
more likely than other NSAIDs to have adverse CNS effects. Of
all the NSAIDs, indomethacin has the most adverse effects.
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Skeletal muscle relaxants
■Carisoprodol
■Chlorzoxazone
■Cyclobenzaprine
■Metaxalone
■Methocarbamol
■Orphenadrine
Avoid: Most muscle relaxants poorly tolerated by older adults
because some have anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation,
increased risk of fractures; effectiveness at dosages tolerated by
older adults questionable
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
Genitourinary
Desmopressin
Avoid for treatment of nocturia or nocturnal polyuria: High
risk of hyponatremia; safer alternative treatments
QE = Moderate; SR = Strong
