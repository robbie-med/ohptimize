20. CHILD ABUSE
INTRODUCTION: The components necessary for the clinician to adequately address
child maltreatment include awareness of the problem, recognition, disclosure, understanding
(clinician and victim) and advocacy
DEFINITIONS
Child abuse or neglect: Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker,
which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or
an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm
Sexual abuse
The employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of any child
to engage in, or assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct or
simulation of such conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such
conduct; or
The rape, and in cases of caretaker or inter-familial relationships, statutory rape,
molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of children, or incest
with children
Withholding of medically indicated treatment: The failure to respond to the infant’s life-
threatening conditions by providing treatment (including appropriate nutrition, hydration,
and medication)
TYPES OF MALTREATMENT
Neglect (most common type of abuse in the U.S.): Failure of a parent or caregiver to
provide for the child
Physical: Failure to provide food, shelter or appropriate supervision
Medical: Failure to provide necessary medical, dental or mental health treatment
Emotional: Failure to attend to the child’s emotional needs or to provide psychological
care
Permitting the child to use dangerous substances such as alcohol or drugs, prena-
tal exposure of a fetus to harm
Educational: Failure to provide educational or special educational needs of the
child
Abandonment: Leaving a child alone in situations where the child suffers serious
harm
Physical (second most common type of abuse in the U.S.): Non-accidental/purposeful
physical injury ranging from minor bruising to severe fractures or death. These injuries are
considered abuse regardless of caregiver’s intent
Sexual (third most reported type of abuse in the U.S.): The employment, use, persuasion,
inducement, enticement, or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any other person to
engage in, any sexually explicit conduct or simulation
Emotional: A pattern of behavior impairing a child’s emotional development or self-
esteem; continued criticism, threats, rejection, withholding love or affection, support or
guidance
BACKGROUND: Epidemiology
Incidence (All types of abuse)
3.3 million referrals involving 6 million children
24% of investigations confirmed one or more victims of abuse
Highest rate of victimization occurs to children 1 year of age
69
PEDS
Sexual abuse incidence
34% of victims under the age of 12
14% of victims under the age of 6
40% of perpetrators to victims younger than 6 are juveniles
Most victims know the perpetrator
Deaths
1770 deaths (~5/day)
Approximately 81% of all fatalities < 4 years of age
Perpetrator
Parent (78.5%)
Other relative (6.5%)
Unmarried partner (4.1%)
Female (58%); Male (42%)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Infectious
Bullous impetigo
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
Bacterial or viral petechiae
Congenital or genetically-acquired
Osteogenesis imperfecta
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Metabolic
Rickets
Electrolyte disturbances
Dermatologic
Dermatitis
Mongolian spots
Vascular malformation
Subcutaneous lipoma or necrosis
Hematologic
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
Henoch-Schönlein purpura
Von Willebrand’s disease
Hemophilia
Accidental or situational
History is key in these situations. A history that is inconsistent with physical exam
findings is highly suspicious for abuse
High pain threshold
Nursemaid’s elbow
Stress fractures
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
History
General: Behavioral indicators
Do the child and caregiver make appropriate eye contact with each other?
Is the interaction between child and caregiver appropriate?
Does the caregiver minimize or deny existence of the child’s problems?
Does the caregiver blame the child for the child’s problems?
Does the caregiver see the child as burdensome, “bad,” worthless or useless?
Does the caregiver look to the child for care, attention or emotional needs?
Physical maltreatment
Is there a “magical (spontaneously appearing)” injury?
Is the injury consistent with the history?
Is the child disabled or frequently ill with multiple problems?
Is the child alone for increasing periods of time (“home-alone” syndrome)?
70
PEDS
Are there behavioral or developmental difficulties?
Is there a history of domestic violence in the home?
Are there frequent visits to medical personnel with or without clearly defined
diagnoses?
Are there different forms of injuries (e.g., burns and bruising together)?
Are there injuries in various stages of healing?
Are there pathognomonic or patterned injuries such as belt or cord marks?
Neglect
Is the child constantly hungry, fatigued or listless?
Does the child have poor hygiene?
Is the child appropriately dressed?
Are there unattended physical or dental problems?
Is there a failure to thrive?
Sexual (the clinician should note that the child’s report is the single most significant
indicator of sexual abuse)
Are there changes in behavior such as anorexia, nightmares, insomnia, excessive
bathing or hand washing activities, withdrawal from usual activities?
Is there a return to thumb-sucking or nocturnal enuresis?
Is there a difficulty in concentrating at school and/or an unwillingness to attend
school?
Irritation or bleeding, swelling, pain, itching, cuts, or bruises in genital, vaginal or
anal areas?
Does the patient cry without provocation?
Is there an inappropriate display of sexuality, or sexual knowledge by the child?
Physical examination (note location, size, color, shape of all obvious injuries)
Inspect for obvious injuries, signs of neglect, or other obvious concerns
Examine eye grounds and ear canals for occult injuries (retinal injuries or
hemotympanum suggestive of coup-contrecoup injury—shaken baby syndrome)
Examine the oral cavity, groin and scalp
Measure and record each injury: Take photographs
Note irritability, vomiting, abnormal respiration or alterations in consciousness
Bruises/abrasions/lacerations
Unexplained injuries to buttocks, back, thighs, torso, ears, and neck
“Normal” childhood bruising typically presents anteriorly on shins, forehead and
forearms. Note: Bruises in a non-ambulatory infant are suspicious
Look for shaped or patterned bruising or injury. Encirclement of injury as occurs
with flexible objects such as belts or cords, etc. should raise suspicion
Burns
Cigarette or cigar: Reddened circumference with central zone of eschar
Immersion injuries to hands or feet secondary to scalding, typically bilateral
Immersion or “doughnut” burns from submersion in hot water, encircling buttocks
Unexplained or excessive splash burn injuries
RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION
Multiple fractures (especially if in various stages of healing)
Epiphyseal separation or metaphyseal lesion: Bucket handle fractures
Posterior or multiple rib fractures—especially in infants—may be in conjunction with
coup-contrecoup injuries
Skull fractures, especially in infants without a clear history of trauma, especially if
complex
Digital fractures, especially without a clear mechanism of injury
Vertebral fractures/subluxations or dislocations
Scapular fractures
Sternal fractures
71
PEDS
DISCLOSURE
Phases
Self: The victim must internally understand the victimization
Confidant selection-reaction: The victim typically chooses a time, place and person
Consequences: Informs victim as to continue or not
Reasons for non-disclosure
Family
Not believed
Shame
Fear of causing trouble
Child Protective Services (CPS) or other services
Ignorance of resources
Service functioning: Overwhelming, supportive?
Secrecy: Other cultural aspects
Mistrust of adults and/or other professionals
Eliciting disclosure
Raise index of suspicion
Engage child: Ask direct questions
Create appropriate situation conducive to disclosure and trust
Provide positive emotional suggestions and support
INTERVENTION
Manage life-threatening situations
Attend to obvious injuries
Activate social services and/or child protective services network: Determine in collabo-
ration with social services safe disposition of the child
Document with great care: Frequently becomes evidence in criminal prosecutions
Maintain resources for parents, caregivers and staff
