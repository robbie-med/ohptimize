27. FERTILITY AWARENESS-BASED MEDICINE:
CREIGHTON MODEL
INTRODUCTION
Standardized method of identifying a woman’s fertility or infertility based on cervical
mucus observations
Works cooperatively with a woman’s menstrual and fertility cycle
Combines with Natural Procreative (NaPro) technology for targeted medical and surgical
treatments
Avoiding pregnancy: Avoid intercourse on days of fertility
Use effectiveness 96.8%
Method effectiveness 99.5%
Achieving pregnancy: Use days of fertility for intercourse
Normal fertility: 98% will conceive in 6 months
Infertility: Identifies and treats underlying cause of infertility
80% will conceive with the combined use of Creighton Model and NaPro
technology
Multiple gestations
Creighton Model: 3.2%
IVF: 10–45% depending on 2–3 embryo transfer
Provides options for treating other common gynecologic medical conditions through
NaPro technology, such as endometriosis and PCOS
PHYSIOLOGY OF CERVICAL MUCUS AND FERTILITY
Cervical mucus acts as a biological valve, either facilitating or inhibiting sperm motility
through the cervix
Cervical crypts in endocervical canal produce E-type and G-type mucus
E-type mucus
Stimulated by estrogen, specifically the estrogen peak that stimulates ovulation
Forms channels that facilitate sperm motility through the cervix
Peak type mucus is described as clear, stretchy or lubricative
Non-peak type mucus is any other
G-type mucus
Stimulated by progesterone in the luteal phase
Increased viscosity makes cervix impenetrable to sperm
Peak day is defined as the last day of peak-type mucus during the cycle
Follicular phase is the first day of bleeding until the day before peak day
Luteal phase is Peak Day until the first day of bleeding
Women confidently identify the days of fertility and infertility
Fertile
Days of menstrual flow (unable to detect mucus)
Mucus days through 3 full days post peak
Infertile
Dry days following menstrual flow
4th day post peak until next menses
PATIENT EDUCATION
Taught by physician practitioners and allied health professionals
Standard method individualized to each woman

OB-GYN
Follow-up visits to ensure charting correctly
Universal coding allows for international use
Check mucus with external vulvar observations, NOT internal exam. Wipe the vaginal
opening with tissue from front to back through the perineal body.
3 steps: SOFT
S-Sensation. Is there lubrication or not? This is an obvious sensation
O-Observe the tissue for mucus
FT-Finger test any available mucus on the tissue
Check before and after using the bathroom and at the end of day.
Place a stamp using the recording system at the end of day to identify a day of fertility or
infertility. Do this daily throughout entire cycle
OPTIMIZING WOMEN’S FERTILITY AND GYNECOLOGIC HEALTH
Abnormal bleeding, PMS, PMDD, Postpartum depression
Targeted, cooperative therapy based on detected estrogen and progesterone
deficiencies
Method relies on accurate charting, labs and imaging relative to Peak Day
Infertility: Includes medical and surgical treatments for PCOS and Endometriosis
Prevention of preterm labor, delivery and multiple gestations for subsequent reduction of
infant mortality
Creighton Model can be used at all times during a woman’s gynecologic life, including
adolescence, peri-menopause, infertility, post-pill, breastfeeding, post-abortion and post-
sterilization
CLINICAL PEARLS
There are no taking chances with the Creighton Method: women confidently identify if
they are fertile or infertile on any given day
Creighton Model is a safe, inexpensive method to avoid pregnancy for those with
contraindications to contraceptives or with personal preference to avoid artificial means of
contraception
High success rate for those with infertility when combined with NaPro technology with
low multiple gestation rate
NaPro technology and charting identifies and treats the underlying cause in several
gynecologic conditions
