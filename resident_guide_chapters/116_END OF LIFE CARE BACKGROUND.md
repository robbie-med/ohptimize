116. END OF LIFE CARE
BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION
As the population ages, the percentage of patients who will need end of life care will increase.
Common diagnoses requiring care include stroke, end stage congestive heart failure, end
stage COPD, and end stage renal disease. Symptom management is one of the primary tenets
of palliative care
SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
Objective is to control symptoms by the fastest, most efficacious route. This may be oral,
subcutaneous, IV, or rectal
Pain
Occurs in nearly 50% of people in last month of life
Need to recognize total pain; may include physical symptoms, as well as possible
psychological, social and spiritual components
Opioids are the mainstay of physical pain control
Pain medication: Morphine and hydromorphone are preferred opioids. Can also
consider oxycodone and fentanyl. These medications are available for administration
via multiple routes
If opioid naïve, start at lowest dose and titrate upwards
Providers can calculate total daily dosage to control symptoms
If already on opioid, use half of the scheduled dose for breakthrough dosing 1 hour
PRN; titrate daily dose as needed
Respiratory depression is rare with adequate pain management
At appropriate doses, opioids do not compromise respiratory status or hasten death
Dyspnea
Tachypnea, increased work of breathing, restlessness, and grunting can all be clinical
signs of dyspnea
Dyspnea follows a complex pathway in a similar region of the brain to pain. Treatment
is often a multiple modality regimen
Opioids are medication of choice for dyspnea, and can help to reduce sensation of air
hunger
Provide fan at bedside for comfort
Social support and distraction (e.g., listening to music) may be helpful
Anxiety
Ensure that pain is adequately controlled when treating anxiety
Lorazepam (Ativan) is preferred benzodiazepine for anxiety. Using long-acting
benzodiazepine such as Diazepam (Valium) is not recommended
Secretions
Common to lose ability to manage secretions during the dying process. Can result
in noising breathing, sometimes referred to as a death rattle. Can be distressing to
caretakers
Important to normalize and destigmatize breathing pattern
Glycopyrrolate (Robinul), hyoscyamine (Levsin), atropine, and scopolamine can be
considered
Mouth care is essential for patient
Delirium
Important to assess for any reversible causes of delirium first. Consider adverse
medication effects, pain, constipation, or urinary retention
Antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol and risperidone can be effective. Given

at lower dosing than for psychiatric disorders
Benzodiazepines should be used with caution
Nausea/Vomiting
Attempt to identify the source of nausea and vomiting, then treat accordingly
Medications that target dopaminergic pathways are used first-line: haloperidol,
risperidone, metoclopramide, and prochlorperazine
Nausea due to increased intracranial pressure should respond best to steroids, e.g.,
dexamethasone
Nausea due to chemotherapy may respond to ondansetron (Zofran)
Nausea due to constipation may respond to metoclopramide (Reglan)
Nausea due to anxiety may respond best to lorazepam
Nausea due to a vestibular component may respond to meclizine (Antivert)
Could consider acupuncture for nonresponsive nausea and vomiting
If no improvement, need to consider severe constipation or bowel obstruction
Constipation
Can lead to pain, vomiting, restlessness, and delirium if not properly managed
Initiate therapy concurrently with prescription of opioid pain medication
Consider docusate sodium as a softening agent, as well as adding sennosides as a
motility agent. Also consider polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX) or magnesium citrate
If still unresponsive, recommend Lactulose on a scheduled basis
Bisacodyl may be used as a suppository and may be associated with less cramping
Methylnaltrexone is approved for treatment of opioid-induced constipation that has not
responded to typical treatment regimens. High cost may limit its use
Family meetings
Address expectations
Initiate discussion of the dying process with families so that they are not alarmed by
irregular breathing or movements by the patient
Recommend stopping all IV medications and blood draws
Nutrition has not been shown to prolong life and may cause more harm secondary to
aspiration risk
Code status
See Chapter 115, Advance Care Planning
Begin discussion early in process
Prognostication
Physicians are very poor prognosticators regarding disease and dying. Remind families
that even though the life supportive measures have stopped, the patient may continue
in the dying process for several days to weeks
CLINICAL PEARLS
End of life care is best provided by a team of providers, including nurses, social workers,
spiritual professional or chaplain, pharmacist, and physicians
Team approach may help to address total pain, including physical, emotional,
psychological, or spiritual components
Dyspnea receptors are in the same region of the brain as pain receptors. Therefore, the
same modalities that work on pain management work for dyspnea. Approach should be
multi-faceted, including medication, positioning, breathing techniques, and social and
spiritual support
Easing the dying process for families and patients is an essential component of the
physician and patient care continuity relationship. Therefore, becoming skilled in this area
of care is invaluable to the patient, family and the physician
