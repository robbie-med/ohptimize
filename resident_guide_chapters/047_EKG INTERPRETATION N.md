47. EKG INTERPRETATION
Note: All criteria listed below are not required for diagnosis
SEQUENCE TO READ EKG
Rate: Rate < 60 = bradycardia, rate > 100 = tachycardia (can calculate 300/# large boxes)
Rhythm: Sinus (P for every QRS, QRS for every P), junctional (narrow QRS), ventricular
(wide QRS)
Axis: Normal axis is -30° to +100°
Hypertrophy and heart block: Atrial or ventricular hypertrophy (check P, QRS), heart
block (check PR interval, P before each QRS, etc.) and bundle branch block (RBBB,
LBBB, LAHB, LPHB)
Ischemia/infarction: Q waves, ST elevation or depression, hyperacute or inverted T waves
Electrolyte or Digoxin disturbances: Check QT, U waves

ventricular myocardium). QTc = QT (seconds) / √RR (seconds)

DRUG EFFECTS
Digitalis
Digitalis effect: Seen in most patients on Digitalis. Digitalis is often stopped several
days before exercise stress testing so that Digitalis effect (ST depression, T wave
changes) will not be confused with ischemia
Increased PR interval
ST segment depression (down sloping ST segment)
Flattening of T waves, diphasic T, inverted T
Shortening of QT interval
Increase of U wave amplitude
Digitalis toxicity: This is a clinical and not an EKG diagnosis
Evidence of increased automaticity and impaired conduction
Examples: Bradycardia, junctional rhythm, AV block, PAT with 2:1 AV block,
PVCs, bi-/trigeminy, A. Fib, V. Tach, V. Fib
ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITIES
Hyperkalemia
Tall, narrow, peaked T waves (hyperacute T waves)
Widening of QRS > 0.10 seconds
Wide, flat P waves
Bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, AV block, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest
Hypokalemia
Flattening and inversion of T wave
Prominent U wave

Ventricular ectopy and AV block
Hypercalcemia: Decreased QT interval, U waves
Hypocalcemia (hypomagnesemia): Increased QT interval
EKG CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS CONDITIONS
Pulmonary embolism (PE): Sinus tachycardia (most common); S in lead I, Q in lead III,
inverted T in lead III (classic S1Q3T3); RAD, ST segment decreased in lead II, transient
RBBB, T wave inversion in right precordial leads, right atrial enlargement
Chronic lung disease: RAD, RVH, right atrial enlargement, low voltage, multifocal atrial
tachycardia (MAT), right atrial enlargement
Pericardial effusion: Sinus tachycardia, electrical alternans, low voltage (< 5mm), ST
segment elevation
204
LABS
LV strain: Depressed and wavy ST segment in V5
RV strain: Depressed and wavy ST segment in V2
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW): PR < 0.12, QRS > 0.11, delta wave, ST/T
changes, associated with paroxysmal tachycardia
Ventricular aneurysm: Persistent ST elevation (> 2 weeks) after MI (usually anterior MI)
Early repolarization/normal variant: QRS slurs into ST with high J point and concave
up ST segment, most common in lateral and inferior leads
Pericarditis: Diffuse ST segment elevation (concave) present in all leads except aVR and
V1, PR segment depression, QRS changes are absent
Hypothermia: Prolonged PR, prolonged QTc, sinus bradycardia syndrome
Sick sinus syndrome: Severe sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, bradycardia alternating with
tachycardia, chronic atrial fibrillation,AV junctional escape rhythm
CLINICAL PEARLS
Consider obtaining a baseline EKG for comparison in patients with cardiac risk factors
ST elevations/depression associated with myocardial ischemia are often associated with
T-wave inversions or changes
The most common EKG abnormality in PE is sinus tachycardia (classic S1Q3T3 much less
common)
