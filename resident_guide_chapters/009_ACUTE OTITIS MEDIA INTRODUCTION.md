9. ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA
INTRODUCTION—The AAP clinical guideline on otitis media in children 6 months through
12 years was last updated in March 2013 and reaffirmed in 2019
Acute otitis media (AOM) affects about 25% of children ≤1 year of age and 60% of
children by age 5 years
Environmental risk factors include exposure to second-hand smoke, bottle feeding, and
enrollment in day care
General management considerations
Approximately 80% of cases of AOM achieve clinical resolution without antibiotic
therapy within 7 days
Rate of mastoiditis in untreated patients is approximately 1/1,000
AOM is the most common diagnosis for childhood antibiotic prescriptions
Studies addressing the use of specific antibiotics and duration of antibiotic therapy
failed to demonstrate superiority of any one regimen over another
ETIOLOGY
AOM usually caused by one of three bacteria: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzæ
(nontypeable), and M. catarrhalis
Since the introduction of PCV7 in 2000, the prevalence of pneumococcal vaccine
serotypes has decreased with an increase in prevalence of H influenza and M.
catarrhalis
In chronic serous otitis media, the most common bacterial agents include P.
aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. viridans, and S. pneumonia
DIAGNOSIS
Clinicians should diagnose AOM in children who present with moderate to severe
bulging of the tympanic membrane or new onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa
Clinicians may diagnose AOM in children who present with mild bulging of the tympanic
membrane and recent (less than 48 hours) onset of ear pain (holding, tugging, rubbing of
the ear in a nonverbal child) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane
Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion
(based on pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry)
Signs/Symptoms
Ear pain (47–83%)
Fever (22–69%)
Associated respiratory symptoms including cough and/or rhinitis (94%)
Irritability (56%)
Pulling at ear (12%)
Drainage from ear (if tympanic membrane is ruptured)
Physical exam
Middle ear effusion (bulging tympanic membrane, cloudy tympanic membrane,
impaired mobility of tympanic membrane, air fluid level, otorrhea)
Inflammation (erythema of the tympanic membrane, otalgia)
Diagnosis of AOM requires
Acute onset of signs and symptoms
Middle ear effusion (MEE)
Middle ear inflammation

PEDS
TREATMENT
Symptom control
Antipyretics/Analgesics (oral) if pain is present
Acetaminophen 15mg/kg every 4–6 hours, max 5 doses/day (susp. 160 mg/5cc)
Ibuprofen 10mg/kg every 8 hours, max 40mg/kg/day (drops 50mg/1.25mL, susp.
100mg/5cc)
Otic treatments are not recommended (unless ear tubes in place)
Decongestants and antihistamines are not recommended
Recommendations for initial management for uncomplicated AOM
Antibiotic therapy
Children < 6 months with AOM should be treated immediately with an appropriate
antibiotics
Children ≥6 months with AOM should be managed according to severity of
symptoms, otorrhea, and laterality
Pediatric Outpatient Treatment Recommendations
Condition
Epidemiology
Diagnosis
Management
Acute otitis
media (AOM)
AOM is the most
common childhood
infection for which
antibiotics are
prescribed.
4-10% of children
with AOM treated
with antibiotics
experience adverse
effects.
Definitive diagnosis requires either
Moderate or severe bulging of
tympanic membrane (TM) or new
onset otorrhea not due to otitis
externa.
Mild bulging of the TM AND recent
(<48h) onset of otalgia (holding,
tugging, rubbing of the ear in a
nonverbal child) or intense erythema
of the TM.
AOM should not be diagnosed in
children without middle ear effusion
(based on pneumatic otoscopy and/or
tympanometry).
Mild cases with unilateral symptoms in
children 6-23 months of age or unilateral or
bilateral symptoms in children >2 years may
be appropriate for watchful waiting based on
shared decision-making.
Amoxicillin remains first line therapy for
children who have not received amoxicillin
within the past 30 days.
Amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended if
amoxicillin has been taken within the past
30 days, if concurrent purulent conjunctivitis
is present, or if the child has a history of
recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin.
For children with a non-type I
hypersensitivity to penicillin: cefdinir,
cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or ceftriaxone may
be appropriate choices.
Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended
to reduce the frequency of recurrent AOM.
For further recommendations on alternative
antibiotic regimens, consult the American
Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.

Antibiotic therapy
Amoxicillin is the initial antibiotic of choice if the child has not received amoxicillin
in the past 30 days or the child does not have concurrent purulent conjunctivitis
Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) is the alternative to amoxicillin or if the child
is unresponsive to amoxicillin after 48–72 hours of initial antibiotic treatment and for
additional β-lactamase coverage
Refer to the following Table for the recommended antibiotic therapy

PEDS
Duration of therapy
10 days for < 2 years-old and children with severe symptoms
7 days for children 2–5 years-old with mild or moderate AOM
5–7 days for children ≥6 years-old with mild or moderate AOM
General
Patients should be re-evaluated in 2 weeks evaluation for resolution of infection
If there is presence of a middle ear effusion, consider
Re-evaluate in 6 weeks
Re-treat with different antibiotic
TREATMENT FAILURE: No response to initial management (observation or antibiotics)
after 48–72 hours
Reassess the patient and confirm the presence of AOM
Consider other diagnoses
Mastoiditis
Meningitis
Other infections
Management
Observation failure: High-dose Amoxicillin (or Amoxicillin-Clavulanate with fever >
39°C)
Amoxicillin failure: High dose Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (or Ceftriaxone with fever >
39°C)
Penicillin allergy: Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin (30–40mg/kg/day divided TID ± 3rd
generation Cephalosporin or Tympanocentesis with fever > 39°C)
OTHER
Persistent middle ear effusion (OME)
Effusion may persist for 2–3 months after treatment of AOM; this is expected and does
not require retreatment
Check hearing at 3 months in patients with cognitive or developmental delay
Recurrent OM
Definition: 3 episodes of OM in 6 months or 4 episodes in 12 months
Consider other diagnosis
Sinusitis
Allergies
Immune deficiencies (C3 and C5 deficiency)
Submucous cleft palate
Tumor of the nasopharynx
Prevention
Clinicians should not prescribe prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the frequency of
episodes of AOM in children with recurrent AOM
Clinicians may offer tympanostomy tubes for recurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6
months or 4 episodes in 1 year with 1 episode in the preceding 6 months)
Ruptured TM
Treat with Cortisporin Otic Suspension 2 drops 4 ×/day for 3–5 days in addition to oral
antibiotics per above recommendations
Fluoroquinolone otic solutions (Ofloxacin otic) is approved for AOM in children ≥1
year of age with tympanostomy tubes
Penicillin Allergy?

Continued otorrhea despite oral antibiotics may necessitate a culture of the drainage
from the perforation site
Careful otologic examination is required for otorrhea lasting longer than 2 weeks
despite antibiotic use
Chronic otorrhea (lasting 6 or more weeks) is most commonly caused by chronic
serous otitis media but may be caused by a myriad of different processes including
cholesteatoma, foreign body, granuloma, immunodeficiency and neoplasm
Serous OM
Persistent middle ear effusion without infection
Check hearing at 3 months. If decreased, refer to ENT
No role for steroids or decongestants. Oral antibiotic usually not necessary
PREVENTION
Clinicians should encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months
Clinicians should encourage avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure
Clinicians should recommend annual influenza vaccine to all children according to the
schedule of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, AAP, and AAFP.
30% efficiency during respiratory illness season
Clinicians should recommend pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to all children according
to the schedule of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American
Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine shows a 6%
reduction in AOM
CLINICAL PEARLS
Decongestants, antihistamines, and glucocorticoids have not been shown to be helpful with
AOM
An erythematous TM may be caused by crying or fever. AOM should not be diagnosed
Recurrent OM may result in hearing loss. Be alert for behavioral changes or learning
difficulties
Breast feeding for at least 4–6 months decreases risk of AOM and recurrent AOM
