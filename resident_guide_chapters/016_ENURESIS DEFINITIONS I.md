16. ENURESIS
DEFINITIONS
Involuntary or intentional loss of urine into bedclothes or undergarments after age 5,
without medical or medication causes
Primary enuresis refers to a failure to ever achieve bladder control. Primary nocturnal
enuresis accounts for 90% of all causes of enuresis and is 3 times as common in boys
Secondary enuresis refers to a return to incontinence after bladder control was previ-
ously achieved and is usually associated with psychological stressors (birth of a sibling,
significant loss or family discord anxiety, or psychiatric disorders)
ETIOLOGY
Delayed maturation of the cortical mechanisms that allow voluntary control of the
micturition reflex
Reduced antidiuretic hormone production at night, resulting in an increased urine output
Genetic factors, with chromosomes 12 and 13q the likely sites of the gene for enuresis:
if one parent was enuretic, each child has a 44% risk of enuresis; if both parents were
enuretic, each child has a 77% likelihood of enuresis
Psychologic factors
Organic factors, such as urinary tract infection (UTI) or obstructive uropathy
Sleep apnea
HISTORY: Should focus on fluid intake at night and pattern of nocturnal enuresis
Type and severity: Determine if the episodes of enuresis are nocturnal (nighttime), diurnal
(daytime), mixed (day and night) and primary or secondary. Determine number of enuretic
nights per week, the number of episodes per night, and the amount voided with each
episode
Voiding history: Weak urinary stream, urgency, infrequent voiding, previous UTI,
encopresis, constipation
Evaluation for other conditions which may cause enuresis including diabetes,
constipation, seizure disorders, neurologic disorders, UTIs
Family history: Enuresis or urinary tract abnormalities
PHYSICAL EXAM
Neurologic: Complete neurological exam
Spinal cord pathology: Inspect back for evidence of sacral dimpling or cutaneous
abnormalities suggesting spinal pathology
Abdominal and genital exam
Rectal exam: Consider performing after voiding to assess for chronically distended
bladder
LABORATORY EVALUATION
Urinalysis and urine culture to exclude renal, metabolic, and infectious pathology
If indicated, consider a renal sonogram, a voiding cystourethrogram, and spine films (if
spinal pathology is suspected on history and physical)
TREATMENT: Most important part of care is to reassure parents that enuresis is self-limited
and to avoid punitive measures that may adversely affect the child’s psychologic development.
Pharmacologic treatment should not be used in children less than 6 years-old
Fluid restriction: Usually after 7 PM
Less than 75lbs: 2 oz

PEDS
75–100lbs: 3 oz
100lbs or more: 4 oz
In addition, the parents should be certain that the child voids at bedtime
Star chart for dry nights: Positive reinforcement
Conditioning therapy: Auditory alarm attached to electrodes in the underwear. The alarm
sounds when voiding occurs and is intended to awaken children and alert them to void.
Therapy is curative with success rate of 30–60%
Desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets: Approved for ≥6 years of age
Consider first-line pharmacologic therapy
Give the dose 1 hour before bedtime
Start with 0.2mg at bedtime. If complete dryness is not achieved after 1–2 weeks,
increase dose to 0.4mg. Most guidelines do not recommend exceeding the dose of
0.4mg
Assess response at 4 weeks
If there are signs of a response, continue treatment × 3 months. May continue
treatment up to 6 months if needed
If there is a lack of response, consider stopping DDAVP therapy. The most
common reason for unresponsiveness is reduced nocturnal bladder capacity.
Another cause is persistent nocturnal polyuria
Tapering Desmopressin gradually if using repeated courses
Efficacy: 30% of patients achieve total dryness. 40% have decreased in nighttime
wetting. 60–70% relapse after discontinuation of therapy
Adverse effects: Water intoxication with hyponatremia. Discontinue the drug if
headache, nausea, or vomiting develops. Advise the parents not to administer the
medication on nights when there is excess fluid intake. Withdraw Desmopressin at
times of sickle cell crisis
Desmopressin nasal spray is no longer indicated for enuresis due to a high risk for
water intoxication
Oxybutynin (Ditropan): Indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder in adults
Consider a second-line therapy for children who do not have a response to other
therapies
As an anticholinergic drug, it increases bladder capacity and reduces detrusor
overactivity
Efficacy: Not effective as monotherapy; better response if combined with
Desmopressin
Dose: Give 5mg before bedtime
Adverse effects: Constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, tachycardia,
headache, nausea and GI upset
Imipramine (Tofranil): Indicated for enuresis in children ≥6 years of age
Consider a third-line therapy, when all other therapeutic options have failed
Give 25mg 1 hour before bedtime; if response is not achieved after 1–2 weeks, may
increase the dose to 50mg in children 7–12 years of age and up to 75mg in older
children
Assess in 3 months for response
Withdraw Imipramine gradually when stopping treatment
Efficacy: 20% of children became dry when compared to placebo
Adverse effects: mood changes, nausea, sleep disturbance, seizure, and cardiotoxicity
with potential for death with overdose
CLINICAL PEARLS
Incidence of primary nocturnal enuresis is 15% at age 5, 3–5% at age 10, and 1% at age 14
Primary nocturnal enuresis accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of enuresis
Spontaneous remission occurs at about 15% per year
23–36% of parents use punishment for enuresis. Should focus on positive reinforcement
(star charts) instead
