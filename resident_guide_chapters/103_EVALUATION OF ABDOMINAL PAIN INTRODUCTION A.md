103. EVALUATION OF ABDOMINAL PAIN
INTRODUCTION
Abdominal pain is a common ambulatory presenting complaint. While etiology is most
often benign, must rule our life-threatening pathology
Special considerations should be taken with the elderly, immunocompromised, and
women of childbearing age
HISTORY
Pain
Onset and duration: Abrupt (vascular, perforation, torsion, or colic) vs. gradual
(inflammation, infection). Was patient awakened from sleep?
Location: Site of onset/site presently (have patient point with one finger to area of
worst pain)
Quality/Character: Visceral pain (steady ache or vague discomfort or excruciating or
colicky pain); parietal pain (more localized to specific site); referred pain (e.g., renal
colic may refer pain to the testicles or labia, biliary pain may be referred to the right
infrascapular region)
Severity
Constant vs. intermittent
Aggravating and alleviating factors (movement, coughing, respiration food, vomiting,
medications, lying still, car ride)
Evolution over time (better/worse/same)
Previous similar episodes
Associated symptoms
Fever: Rectal temperature most reliable. Elderly/immunocompromised may be less
able to mount fever as immune response
Emesis: Examine time relationship of abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as
frequency and character of emesis (color and bilious, bloody, coffee ground, etc.), and
most recent meal prior to emesis
Anorexia: Usually associated with acute abdominal pain; often precedes the onset of
pain in appendicitis
GI: Constipation, diarrhea, recent change in bowel habits. Watery diarrhea with
crampy pain and absence of red-flag symptoms suggests gastroenteritis. Failure to
pass flatus with crampy pain and vomiting suggests mechanical obstruction. Bloody
diarrhea (infectious), bright red blood (lower GI causes—diverticulosis, neoplasm,
infection, IBD, AVM, hemorrhoids, fissures, fistulae, or prolapse), melena (upper GI
causes—peptic ulcer, gastritis, varices, Mallory-Weiss tear)
Urination: Dysuria, frequency, urgency, incontinence, hematuria, back pain
Vaginal: Discharge (PID), bleeding (ectopic, miscarriage)
Menstruation: Last menstrual period, frequency, duration, the type of contraception
and duration of use
Past medical and surgical history
Prior surgeries/hospitalizations
History of similar pain suggests recurrent disease
History of chronic diseases (diabetes, HIV, CNS disease, i.e., multiple sclerosis)
Recent or current medications (including NSAIDs, steroids, pain medications,
antibiotics)
Social history: Tobacco, alcohol and other drugs of abuse, living circumstances, others
with similar symptoms, occupation
Recent out of country travel or exposure to lake, well, or stream water

PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Appearance and degree of discomfort. Look for dehydration (dry mucous
membranes). If patient lies still and winces with even slight bumps to the bed, high
concern for peritonitis
Vital signs: Tachycardia and hypotension may signify hypovolemia. Fever raises concern
for infectious etiology. A variant in blood pressure between the arms and legs may
indicate aortic dissection. Increased respirations may signify metabolic acidosis, DKA,
diaphragmatic irritation, or severe pain
Inspection: Scars, hernias, masses, distention, peristaltic waves, rash (herpes zoster), signs
of liver disease (jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, ascites), pancreatitis (Grey
Turner’s sign—purple/red flanks; Cullen’s sign—red umbilical)
Auscultation: Frequency and pitch of bowel sounds. High pitched bowel sounds may
indicate bowel obstruction. Presence or absence of abdominal bruits
Percussion and palpation
Have patient point “with one finger” to area of greatest pain
Begin in the quadrant free of pain and perform lightly (Note voluntary and involun-
tary guarding, rigidity and rebound)
Organomegaly and other masses including the bladder and hernias. Pulsatile mass
(AAA)
Costovertebral angle tenderness
Genitourinary
Umbilical hernia (and inguinal hernia)
Examine the testicles for swelling and/or retraction
Penis for discharge
Pelvic examination
Both speculum and bimanual examination
GC/Chlamydia cultures, Wet prep/Trichomoniasis evaluation if indicated
Cervical motion tenderness (GU vs. peritonitis), adnexal tenderness, masses,
discharge, bleeding or FBs
Rectal examination
Probe for perirectal mass, fecal impaction, prostate enlargement or irregularity
Guaiac stool
Signs
Psoas sign: Pain on passive extension of the right hip. Suggestive of appendicitis
Obturator sign: Pain with passive flexion and internal rotation of the right hip.
Suggestive of appendicitis
Rovsing’s sign: Referred pain in the RLQ when palpating the LLQ. Suggestive of
appendicitis
Murphy’s sign: Inspiratory arrest with deep palpation of the RUQ. Suggestive of
cholecystitis
Carnett’s sign: Increased tenderness to palpation when abdominal muscles are con-
tracted. Suggestive of abdominal wall pain
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
Plain abdominal radiograph: Clinical utility is limited, may be used for evaluation of
constipation (large stool ball), perforation (free air), obstruction and foreign body, though
sensitivity much better with CT
Both a supine and upright film of the abdomen should be obtained, as well as a PA (+/-
lateral) chest film to exclude intrathoracic causes of acute abdominal pain (e.g., lower
lobe pneumonia or aortic dissection)
Labs
Consider CBC (infection, anemia, appendicitis), electrolytes (fluid status, acidosis),
BUN/Cr, urinalysis (infection, nephrolithiasis), amylase/lipase, LFTs
Ultrasonography: Cholelithiasis, fluid-containing cavities, intraabdominal masses,
intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy, ovarian cyst, and testicular torsion
CT Scan: Useful in diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, mass, appendicitis, diverticular
461
SURG
abscess, kidney stones, pancreatic necrosis, free air, AAA, and many other conditions.
For evaluation of appendicitis, the helical CT with triple contrast (PO, IV, rectal) is about
98% sensitive. If a patient has a clinical diagnosis of appendicitis, consult surgery prior to
obtaining CT, as it may not change management and could provide falsely negative results
Nuclear medicine: May be helpful in diagnosing cholecystitis and testicular torsion
CAUSES OF ABDOMINAL PAIN IN PATIENTS PRESENTING TO AN ED
Diverticulitis
Most common presenting complaint is abdominal pain (usually LLQ, may be RLQ),
often present for several days prior to presentation
May also present with fever, nausea/vomiting, constipation/diarrhea, bloody stools,
hemodynamic instability (concern for peritonitis)

CLINICAL PEARLS
Pain out of proportion to physical exam may suggest ischemic bowel
Most common etiologies of small bowel obstruction are adhesions (extensive surgical
history), hernia, and tumor
Most common etiologies of colonic obstruction are tumor, volvulus, and diverticular
disease
If an abdominal exam is difficult because of increased pain, peritoneal irritation can be
demonstrated by having the patient cough and then asking to point to the area of maximum
tenderness. Be concerned if patient lies still and has intense pain with bumping the bed
