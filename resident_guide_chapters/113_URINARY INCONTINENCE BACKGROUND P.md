113. URINARY INCONTINENCE
BACKGROUND
Prevalence and impact
Urinary incontinence affects 15–35% of community-dwelling adults over age 65, and
50–70% of those in long-term care facilities
The prevalence of urinary incontinence is higher in women until approximately age
80, after age 80 the prevalence is roughly equivalent
Urinary incontinence may be underreported. In a U.S. survey of a multiethnic
population, only 45% of women who reported urinary incontinence occurring at least
once a week ever sought care. It is a source of embarrassment, social isolation, and can
contribute to caregiver burdens which can impact the decision to institutionalize
Pathophysiology of incontinence
Urethral sphincter mechanisms include smooth muscle stimulated by sympathetic
innervation from T11–L2 and distal striated muscle which contracts due to cholinergic
stimulation from the sacral micturition center
Detrusor activity contracts via parasympathetic control from the spinal cord level S2–
S4
CLASSIFICATION OF URINARY INCONTINENCE
Stress incontinence
Urinary leakage associated with increased abdominal pressure, such as cough, sneeze,
or change in position
Generally associated with poor anatomic support
Risk factors include female gender, childbirth, vaginal atrophic changes and prior
medical interventions including surgical and radiation therapy
α-adrenergic blocking agents may increase symptoms
Male stress incontinence is usually associated with prior prostate surgery
Urge incontinence
Urinary leakage associated with an abrupt desire to void
Urge incontinence is most often caused by detrusor overactivity
Often idiopathic, but may be exacerbated by infection, interstitial cystitis, neoplasm,
and bladder stones
Detrusor overactivity may coexist with impaired contractility, which will result in
an elevated residual volume. This subset of urge incontinence will require additional
caution when pharmacologic management is prescribed
Overflow incontinence
Urine loss from an over-distended bladder
Consider outlet obstruction (BPH, stricture, pelvic organ prolapse), fecal impaction,
anticholinergic medications, or neuropathic etiology
Functional incontinence
Physical elements that impede toileting (arthritis, amputation, acute injury, restraints)
Impaired willingness/ability to reach toilet (dementia, delirium, depression, medication
effect)
HISTORY
Symptoms
Determine duration, severity, social impact, and precipitating features of current
symptoms
Comorbid conditions
512
GERI
Diabetes mellitus, neurological history, bowel history, and urogynecological history, as
well as past surgical history
Medication review
Particular attention to α-blockers, diuretics, anticholinergics
Calcium channel blockers (impaired contractility), thiazolidinediones (fluid retention),
and ACE inhibitors (cough) may be of interest depending on symptoms and historical
relationship to a new agent
PHYSICAL EXAM
Cognition and functional status
Formal cognitive function testing when appropriate (See Chapter 114, Evaluation of
Mental Status Changes)
Evaluate for any physical barriers that may impede toileting
Cardiovascular screen
Attention to volume overload contributing to nocturia
Abdominal/pelvic/rectal exam as indicated based on history
Abdominal exam including evaluation for distended bladder/abdominal mass
Rectal exam including tone, perianal sensation, evaluation for mass, or fecal impaction
Pelvic exam including evaluation for inflammation, infection, atrophic changes,
cystocele, rectocele, pelvic organ descent, or urethral hypermobility
Neurological screen
Evaluate for peripheral neuropathy, acute lumbar disc disease, and central nervous
system disorders including normal pressure hydrocephalus if history dictates
LAB/FOCUSED TESTING
Urinalysis and culture
Treat urinary tract infections if indicated
Unexplained hematuria or glycosuria requires further evaluation
Blood work
Renal function as indicated (example BPH, diabetes mellitus, hypertension)
Glucose, possible TSH, Vitamin B12, calcium
Post void residual (PVR) volume
Ultrasound or via catheter
A PVR of < 50mL is normal
100–200mL is indeterminate and should be repeated
Volume in excess of 200mL is abnormal and is suggestive of overflow incontinence
Voiding diary
Requires patient motivation, intact cognition, or motivated caregiver
MANAGEMENT
Stress incontinence
Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises). Consider referral to a pelvic floor
physical therapist. Pelvic floor muscle training plus bladder training is superior in
resolving urinary incontinence in women compared to drug therapy, electrostimulation,
medical devices, injectable bulking agents, and local estrogen therapy
Pelvic floor electrical stimulation (biofeedback): Performed by pelvic floor physical
therapists
There are currently no FDA approved pharmacological interventions for stress
incontinence
α-adrenergic stimulants or topical estrogen therapy may be considered, but literature
support is lacking
Duloxetine (Cymbalta) may increase sphincter contraction
Pessaries: Occlusive device for intravaginal support
Side-effects may include increased vaginal discharge and increased risk for
vaginitis
Surgical treatment
513
GERI
Periurethral collagen injection
Retropubic urethropexy
Suburethral sling
Stress incontinence in men is usually a consequence of prior prostate surgery, and an
artificial sphincter may be corrective
Urge incontinence
Bladder training (timed voiding), biofeedback, pelvic floor exercises, pelvic floor
electrical stimulation
Pharmacologic treatment: Anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin (Ditropan),
tolterodine (Detrol), or solifenacin (Vesicare) may be considered
Side-effects may include dry mouth, blurry vision, dry eyes, delirium, or
constipation. Use caution with anticholinergics in elderly patients
Sacral nerve root neuromodulation with implanted stimulator device
Overflow incontinence
Remove any offending pharmacological agents (anticholinergics)
Scheduled straight catheterization may be of benefit to empty bladder
Address constipation/fecal impaction
In males, address prostatic hypertrophy with selective α-adrenergic agents
(Tamsulosin) and possibly 5 α-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride). See
Chapter 76, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Failure to respond will require urological
consultation and probable surgical intervention (many modalities available)
In males, the digital rectal exam (DRE) and PSA may assist in the evaluation for
prostatic malignancy. A baseline PSA is indicated prior to the initiation of a 5
α-reductase inhibitor
Treat any reversible neurological syndromes (e.g., peripheral neuropathy secondary to
Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism)
Functional incontinence
Treat the offending debility as condition permits
Improve access to toileting
Indwelling catheters: Should be avoided when possible due to infection risk and impaired
mobility. During hospitalizations, should be removed when clinically able
Indications
Skin breakdown of surrounding area (healing is impaired by urinary incontinence)
Failure of intermittent catheterization due to mechanical features, lack of patient
dexterity or available willing caregiver, or strong patient preference for an indwelling
catheter
Care of the terminally ill or severely impaired where toileting is impractical and
incontinence is uncomfortable
Monitoring of urinary output (short-term) or for the collection of a needed accurate 24
hour urine specimen
CLINICAL PEARLS
Urinary incontinence is often under reported
Use medications with caution in the frail elderly and in those with cognitive dysfunction
Utilize nonpharmacological therapy for stress and urge incontinence first or in conjunction
with medication
