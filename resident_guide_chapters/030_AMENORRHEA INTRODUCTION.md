30. AMENORRHEA
INTRODUCTION: First exclude the most common cause: pregnancy. A history and physical
including detailed gynecological exam will guide the evaluation and subsequent lab studies
DEFINITION: Amenorrhea (absence of menses) is divided into the following
Primary: No spontaneous uterine bleeding by age 14 in the absence of the development of
secondary sex characteristics or by age 16 in otherwise normal development
Secondary (more common): Absence of menses for 6 months in women with prior regular
menses or for 12 months in women with prior oligomenorrhea
HISTORY
Medical
Endocrine or metabolic disorders
Galactorrhea (need to exclude pituitary adenoma)
Past or present serious illnesses
Previous radiation therapy or chemotherapy
Recent weight gain or loss/eating disorder
Psychological disturbance/depression/stress
Athletic training/intense exercise
Menstrual
Age at menarche
Date of last menstrual period
Previous menstrual pattern
Events surrounding the onset of amenorrhea
Reproductive
Contraceptive use
Gynecologic or obstetric procedures
Pregnancies—outcomes, complications
Pubertal development
Family
Age of mother and sister(s) at menarche and menopause
Autoimmune disorders
Congenital anomalies
Endocrinopathies
Infertility
Menstrual dysfunction
Tuberculosis
Medications: Associated with amenorrhea
Drugs that increase prolactin
Antipsychotics: Phenothiazines, Haloperidol (Haldol), Pimozide (Orap),
Clozapine (Clozaril)
Antidepressants: Tricyclic antidepressants, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
Antihypertensives: Calcium channel blockers, Methyldopa (Aldomet), Reserpine
Drugs with estrogenic activity: Digitalis, Marijuana, Flavonoids, Oral contraceptives
Drugs with ovarian toxicity: Busulfan (Myleran), Chlorambucil (Leukeran), Cisplatin
(Platinol), Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar), Fluorouracil
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Body habitus and proportion, obesity, body hair extent and distribution
118
OB-GYN
HEENT: Excessive facial hair, acne, funduscopic exam to evaluate for papilledema, visual
fields.Assess thyroid for goiter or nodules
Breast development and presence of galactorrhea (fat globules visible per microscope
exam)
Abdomen: Striae in nulliparous women (hypercortisolism)
Genitalia: Refer to Tanner Stages
LABS
Pregnancy test
See algorithm below for TSH, Prolactin, FSH, and LH
Other labs to consider obtaining to rule out systemic disease include: CBC, Calcium,
Phosphorous, Thyroxine, thyroid antibodies, ESR, total protein, RF, ANA
EVALUATION
*Refer to text for description of these diagnostic tests
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Progesterone challenge test (PCT)
Method: Give Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) (Provera) 10mg PO daily × 5
days, or Progesterone (Prometrium) 400mg PO BID × 5 days
Results: The test is positive if there is any vaginal bleeding within 2–7 days after the
fifth tablet. This confirms a diagnosis of anovulation. There is adequate endogenous
estrogen, and the outflow tract is patent
Estrogen-Progesterone challenge test (E-PCT)
Method: Give Conjugated Estrogen 1.25mg PO daily × 21 days, add MPA (Provera)
10mg (or Progesterone (Prometrium) 400mg PO BID) days 16–21. Repeat cycle if no
bleeding by day 28
Results: A positive test indicates menstruation is possible if adequate stimulatory
estrogen is available. The work-up is depicted in diagram. A negative test requires
referral to a gynecologist for further studies

MANAGEMENT
Anovulation secondary to inadequate Progesterone (i.e., positive PCT) indicates
increased risk of endometrial cancer because of hyperplastic effect of unopposed estrogen.
In addition, there may also be increased risk for breast cancer
To reduce risk of endometrial disease and to provide cycle regularity, give MPA 10mg
PO daily (or Progesterone (Prometrium) 400mg BID) for first 7–10 days of each
month
If pregnancy is desired, consider ovulation induction
If pregnancy is not desired, then give low dose cyclic oral contraceptives
Hypoestrogenic women (i.e., negative PCT and positive E-PCT) should be further
evaluated with LH and FSH (See algorithm above). Elevated levels are indicative of
primary ovarian failure. If onset of amenorrhea is age < 30, chromosomal analysis is
indicated
CLINICAL PEARLS
Normally, the arm span and height measures are similar. If the arm span is 5cm greater
than the height, suspect hypogonadal disease
Prevalence of secondary amenorrhea is higher in certain subgroups such as college
students, ballet dancers, and competitive endurance athletes
