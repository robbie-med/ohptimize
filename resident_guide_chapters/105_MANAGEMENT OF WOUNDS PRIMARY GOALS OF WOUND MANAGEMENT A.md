105. MANAGEMENT OF WOUNDS
PRIMARY GOALS OF WOUND MANAGEMENT
Adequate hemostasis
Prevent and/or treat infection
Cosmetically acceptable scar
Restore function
HISTORY
How, when, and where did the injury occur
Mechanism of injury (risk for retained foreign body, need for prophylactic antibiotics,
ability to close wound)
Determination of allergies to local anesthetics, antibiotics, or latex
Neurovascular or tendon injury
Status of tetanus immunization
PHYSICAL EXAM
Location, length, shape, depth and tension lines of the wound
Associated tissue injury (possibility of joint, tendon or ligament involvement)
Contaminants and foreign bodies
Neurovascular integrity and function
Distal blood flow, capillary refill
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES
Wound cultures are often low-yield due to bacterial colonization, infection of a skin
wound is usually a clinical diagnosis
Consider radiograph to evaluate for foreign object (especially if injury related to broken
glass) or fracture
INITIAL WOUND PREPARATION
Optimal length of time between injury and wound repair has not been adequately defined
Anesthetize wound
Local anesthetic, with epinephrine if concern for bleeding
Prep and drape the area
Explore the wound
Plain radiograph or ultrasound to assess for retained foreign body if indicated
Copious irrigation with normal saline or sterile water, tap water also likely acceptable.
Additional antiseptic solutions unlikely to provide additional benefit
Debride devitalized tissue (in cases of trauma or contaminated/necrotic wound)
Wound closure
Associated with higher rate of healing in wounds less than 19 hours-old (less than 24
hours-old of head/facial wounds)
In cases of delayed presentation, retained glass or foreign body, healing by secondary
intention would be preferred over wound closure
Do not perform primary closure of infected tissue, animal bites, or deep puncture
wounds. Can consider delayed primary closure after irrigation/debridement and 4–5
days of adequate antibiotic therapy
Consider referral to wound management specialist if high risk for poor wound healing
(uncontrolled diabetes, PAD, immune suppression)
Hair removal is not necessary unless it interferes with wound closure or knot formation
Consider short-term placement of a tourniquet for extremity wounds to obtain blood-less field

ANESTHESIA
Anesthetic agents
Topical agents
EMLA cream (Lidocaine 2.5%, Prilocaine 2.5%): Useful for pediatric wounds
Infiltrative
Lidocaine (1% or 2%): Onset < 2 minutes; duration 1.5–2 hours; max dose 4mg/
kg (not to exceed 280mg) or 28mL (1%) or 14mL (2%)
Lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000 or 1:200,000): Onset < 2 minutes; duration
2–6 hours; max dose 7mg/kg (not to exceed 500mg) or 50mL (based on Lidocaine
1%) or 25mL (based on Lidocaine 2%)
Avoid use in digits or areas of limited blood supply due to theoretical risk of
vasoconstriction leading to ischemia/necrosis
Bupivacaine (Marcaine) 0.25%: Onset 5 minutes; duration: 2–4 hours; max dose
2.5mg/kg (not to exceed 175mg) or 50mL
Nerve blocks: Most commonly used for face, hands, and feet
WOUND CLOSURE MATERIAL
Sutures
*Despite its ease of tying, silk suture should generally not be used because of increased tissue
reactivity and chance of infection
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Staples
Advantage: Faster
Precautions: Never use on face
Consider use on scalp, trunk, upper and lower extremities
Topical tissue adhesive
Example: 2-octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond)
Technique: Approximate wound edges and 3 ever larger concentric circles over wound edges
Use only with superficial wounds under low tensile stress
467

SUTURE TECHNIQUE
Follow basic suturing principles: Ensure adequate lighting, comfortable position (for
both patient and physician), ample supply of suture and comfort with type of suture
Most common suture technique is simple interrupted, may also consider vertical mattress
(for high-tension areas), running suture (quick, but risk for malalignment), subcuticular
running suture (low tension, good cosmetic outcomes)
Sutures should be placed with equal depth and width for best results. Insert needle into
skin at 90 degree angle and apply appropriate tension to achieve skin edge eversion.
Sutures should be used to approximate the wound edges and not to pull the wound
together. Don’t hesitate to remove initial sutures and replace as you progress if they lack
appropriate skin tension
When suturing lips, place first suture through vermilion border (junction of lip and skin)
Delayed primary closure is preferred in heavily contaminated wounds if no signs of
infection are present after 3–5 days
BITE WOUNDS
Introduction
Animal bites are common with annual incidence of 2–5 million
Most common causes: Dogs (85–90%); cats (5–10%), rodents (2–3%), humans (2–3%)
Approximately 10% of bite wounds will require suturing and follow-up care
Dog and cat bites carry highest risk of wound infection
Initial evaluation
Generally, bite wounds are primarily closed in very vascular areas and if cosmetically
necessary
Areas usually primarily sutured are face, scalp, and neck. Avoid deep sutures
Consider closing wounds of trunk, arm and legs
Avoid suturing any bite wounds of the hands and feet
Wound preparation: See above. Very important to use copious irrigation and debride-
ment of devitalized tissue
High risk bite wounds
Location: Hand, foot, wrists, joints. In infants: Scalp or face
Type of wound: Crush injuries, puncture wounds, bites involving the hands, cat or
human bites except those to the face, dog bite wounds with delayed presentation, and
bite wounds in immunosuppressed hosts
Patient: Age > 50, asplenic, alcoholic, immunocompromised, diabetic, peripheral
vascular disease, chronic steroid use, prosthetic or diseased cardiac valve or joint
Human bites
Most commonly located on the face, upper extremities, and trunk. Note: Be aware of
closed fist injury (“fight bite”) in young patients with laceration over MCP
Most common organisms include α-hemolytic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus,
Eikenella corrodens, Corynebacterium, and Bacteroides
If there is invasion of the MCP joint capsule (usually from injuries sustained during a
fight), refer to a hand surgeon for possible debridement in the OR
Wound closure
Human bites to the hand should not be closed
Those in other areas may be closed if less than 6 hours-old after adequate
irrigation and debridement
Antibiotic prophylaxis
Consider if high risk for development of infection, or if bite penetrates dermis
1st line therapy: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Alternative two-drug
regimens may include doxycycline, Bactrim, or a fluoroquinolone PLUS
metronidazole or clindamycin (for anaerobic coverage)
Dog wounds
Most often occur by animals known to the patient, usually bite wounds. Most
common organisms include Strep viridans, Pasteurella multocida, S. aureus, E. corrodens,
Bacteroides
468
SURG
Dog bites more likely to be open and tearing wounds
Wound closure
Consider closure if less than 12 hours-old (or 24 hours on the face), lack of
clinical infection
Do NOT close dog bite wounds on the hands/feet, or those wounds at a high risk
for development of infection.
Antibiotic prophylaxis
Only 5% of dog bites become infected
Only administer in cases of wounds at high risk of infection
1stline: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Alternative regimens similar to
human bite wounds
Cat wounds
Usually provoked, biting or claw wounds. Often deep puncture wounds
Most common organisms include staph and strep species and Pasteurella multocida
Pasteurella multocida infection develops within 24 hours
P. multocida is resistant to Cephalexin, Dicloxacillin, Clindamycin; many strains
resistant to Erythromycin
Wound closure: Leave ALL cat bites open to heal by secondary intention
Antibiotic prophylaxis
Should use in all cat bites
1st line: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Alternative regimens similar to
human bite wounds
Antibiotic treatment: Use same drugs as for prophylaxis, but treatment at least 10 days
Rabies prophylaxis
Indications for rabies immunization
If the animal (dog or cat or ferret) is healthy and available for 10-day observation,
use prophylaxis only if animal develops signs of rabies
If the animal is rabid or suspected of being rabid, treat immediately with rabies
vaccine and Rabies immune globulin (RIG)
In unknown or escaped cases, consult public health officials
For patient not previously vaccinated
RIG 20IU/kg as a single dose. The full dose should be infiltrated around the
wounds and any remaining volume should be administered IM at an anatomical
site distant from vaccine administration
Rabies vaccine: 5-dose series: 1.0mL dose given IM in the deltoid area on days
0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. There are two types of vaccines available: Human diploid cell
vaccine (Imovax Rabies) and Purified chick embryo cell vaccine (RabAvert)
For previously vaccinated persons: 2 doses of vaccine (1mL each) given IM, one
immediately and one 3 days later
FOLLOW-UP CARE
General
Topical antibiotics if needed (avoid neomycin due to common skin allergy)
Dressings (non-adherent or sterile gauze)
Splint lacerations over joints
Wounds that should be rechecked in 24–48 hours
Hand wounds
Bite wounds
Heavily contaminated wounds
(See chart on next page)

Tetanus prophylaxis
Tetanus immune globulin (TIG): 250U in a single dose given IM
Tetanus vaccine
Td (Tetanus and diphtheria toxoid adsorbed) for those aged ≥7 years
Tdap (Tetanus, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis)—2 vaccine
products available: Boostrix for ages 10–18, Adacel for ages 11–64
Give TIG and tetanus vaccine (Td or Tdap) IM, using a separate syringe at different
anatomical sites
CLINICAL PEARLS
Irrigate all wounds with sterile saline or tap/sterile water, other antiseptics not shown to
add additional benefit and could delay wound healing
You may obtain wound cultures if clinical suspicion for infection, but do not delay
appropriate antibiotic therapy based on etiology of wound, and this is usually a clinical
diagnosis
Bite/claw wounds are often polymicrobial, empiric treatment includes normal oral flora
coverage
Do NOT close cat bite/claw wounds
Provide Hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccine for any unvaccinated patient bitten by
someone known to be hepatitis B positive (salivary transmission of Hepatitis C or HIV is
extremely rare)
