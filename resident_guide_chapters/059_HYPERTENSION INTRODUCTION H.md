59. HYPERTENSION
INTRODUCTION
Hypertension (HTN) affects more than 50 million people in the U.S. and 1 billion people
worldwide
Uncontrolled HTN is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
Antihypertensive therapy is associated with a 35–40% decreased incidence of stroke, a
20–25% decreased incidence of myocardial infarction, and a 50% decreased incidence of
heart failure
HTN is the most common diagnosis in the U.S. with 35 million office visits/year. 30% of
people with HTN are unaware of their diagnosis
There is a great deal of controversy in current blood pressures (BP) treatment and
diagnosis thresholds. While the recommendations discussed in this Chapter are
based on JNC-7 and the 2014 JNC-8 Expert Committee recommendations, also see
discussion points on how other trials (SPRINT) and guidelines (2017 ACA/ACC HTN
guidelines) differ and may be appropriate for some patients
HISTORY
History of HTN, home monitoring readings, previous/current antihypertensive treatments
(including adverse effects or reasons for stopping)
Screening for other cardiovascular disease risk factors
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
Heart Failure (with or without preserved ejection fraction)
Cerebrovascular disease, history of CVA/TIA
Peripheral vascular disease
Dyslipidemia
Renal disease
Diabetes mellitus
Obesity, physical inactivity
Symptoms suggestive of secondary causes of HTN (OSA, renal artery stenosis,
pheochromocytoma)
Recent changes in weight, physical activity, smoking or other tobacco use, intake of
sodium, alcohol, saturated fat, and caffeine
Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, and illicit drug use
(specifically cocaine)
Socioeconomic factors including ability to obtain healthy foods, afford medications, and
attend physician appointments.
Family history of cardiac disease risk factors
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: accurate blood pressure measurement, pulse, weight, height, waist circumference
Neck: Thyroid enlargement or nodules, carotid bruits, JVD
Eyes: Funduscopic exam for hypertensive retinopathy, papilledema
Lungs: Crackles or other signs of heart failure
CV: Rhythm, rate, gallop, murmur
Abdomen: Bruits (renal artery stenosis), abdominal aneurysm, truncal obesity or striae,
enlarged kidneys, masses
Extremities: Edema, peripheral pulses, femoral bruits
Neuro: Focal deficits consistent with previous CVA
EVALUATION
252
GEN
A complete evaluation of HTN requires accurate blood pressure measurement,
determination of cardiovascular risk, signs of end-organ damage, and consideration of
secondary causes of hypertension
Accurate measurement of blood pressures
Patient factors: Should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes, with empty bladder,
back supported, legs uncrossed with feet on the floor, arm supported at heart level. No
caffeine, strenuous activity or nicotine within 30 minutes
Cuff: Bladder encircles 80% of arm circumference and is placed on the patient’s
uncovered arm 2 cm above the elbow crease just snug enough to allow two fingers to
slide under the cuff. Midline of the cuff bladder is over the brachial artery
Should repeat blood pressure 5 minutes later if elevated to ensure accurate readings.
Consider 3 blood pressure measurements during office visit 5 minutes apart, taking the
average of the 2nd and 3rd reading for accurate BP measurement
Diagnosis
Should include at least 2 separate accurate readings of at least 140 systolic and/or
90 diastolic. 15–30% of patients may have “white coat HTN” (elevated BP in office,
normotensive elsewhere), should confirm readings with 24 or 12 hour ABPM or home
blood pressure monitoring if able
Also consider possibility of “masked HTN” (normotensive in office but elevated
readings at home)
Routine laboratory and diagnostic testing
Creatinine: Screen for chronic kidney disease
Potassium: Unprovoked hypokalemia may suggest hyperaldosteronism
Calcium: Elevated in hyperparathyroidism
Urinalysis: Screen for microscopic proteinuria as an early marker of hypertensive
kidney disease. A ratio of 30–300mcg/mg indicates microalbuminuria, a sign of
chronic kidney disease and a cardiovascular risk factor
Fasting lipid panel: Cardiovascular risk
EKG: Detect LVH (low sensitivity, high specificity), ischemic heart disease
Echocardiogram: Consider if abnormal EKG or signs/symptoms of valvular heart
disease or heart failure present
Secondary hypertension
Consider in patients with risk factors or treatment-resistant HTN (blood pressures
above goal despite 3 drug therapy including a diuretic)
Abdominal bruits: Renal artery stenosis
Daytime fatigue, snoring, obesity: Sleep apnea
Paroxysms of HTN accompanied by headache, palpitations perspiration:
Pheochromocytoma
Abdominal or flank masses: Polycystic kidneys
Delayed or absent femoral pulses: Coarctation of the aorta
Truncal obesity with abdominal striae: Cushing’s or steroid therapy
Unprovoked hypokalemia: Primary aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism should
also be worked up in cases of resistant hypertension regardless of potassium level,
since this is a relatively common cause of secondary hypertension and unproved
hypokalemia is only present in 30% of patients with this condition
Hypercalcemia: Hyperparathyroidism
Elevated creatinine: Renal parenchymal disease

Note: ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines define “elevated BP” as SBP 120–129 and DBP < 30, Stage 1 HTN
as SBP 130–139 or DBP 80–89, and Stage 2 HTN as SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90.
MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
Lifestyle modifications

and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. National Institutes of Health. NIH pub. no. 03–5233 (May
2003), Table 5, Pg. 8.
Initiation of pharmacotherapy and BP Goals (JNC–8):
Medication selection
Four options for 1st line management of HTN, can be used in combination (except for
ACEI-ARB combo)
Thiazide diuretics: HCTZ, chlorthalidone, indapamide
Common side-effects: Polyuria (do not dose before bedtime), hyponatremia,
hypokalemia. May increase risk of non-melanoma skin cancers
Calcium channel blockers (CCB): Amlodipine, diltiazem
Common side-effects: Peripheral edema (dose-dependent), fatigue,
palpitations
ACE Inhibitors (ACEI): Lisinopril, enalapril, captopril
Common side-effects: Dry cough (angiotensin-mediated), angioedema,
hyperkalemia. Pregnancy Category D, avoid in renal artery stenosis
Monitor Cr and K. Should repeat Cr 2–4 weeks after starting, small increase
in Cr expected, but a large increase (greater than 33% may indicate RAS)
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB): Losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan
Common side-effects: Similar to ACEI (less angioedema but still possible)
Specific populations (See algorithm below)

Racial/ethnic considerations: While available evidence supports efficacy
differences between some blood pressure medications between race and ethnicity
groups, consider the possibility of bias in these studies. Use patient-centered
discussions to discuss available evidence and limitations to select an appropriate
medication
General nonblack population including those with diabetes: Thiazide, CCB, ACEI
or ARB
General black population including those with diabetes: Thiazide or CCB
All patients aged ≥18 year with CKD: Treatment should include an ACEI or
ARB (Grade B)
Therapeutic strategy
If BP goal not achieved in one month: increase dose or add a second drug
from one of the recommended drug classes. Select either a Thiazide, CCB,
ACEI, or ARB. Do not use ACEI and ARB together
If BP not at goal with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Choose a drug
outside the classes recommended above only if these options are exhausted.
Refer to a hypertension specialist if needed
Other agents to consider
β–blockers (Metoprolol, Carvedilol, Atenolol): No longer recommended as 1st line
therapy due to reduced efficacy compared to 1st line agents and side-effect profile.
May be indicated in certain populations (heart failure, arrhythmia, history of ACS/
CAD/CABG)
Common side-effects: Bradycardia, fatigue, erectile dysfunction
Aldosterone antagonists (Spironolactone, Eplerenone): May be useful for
concurrent acne and/or androgen suppression, may be indicated in heart failure or
cirrhosis
Common side-effects: Hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, breast tenderness, erectile
dysfunction
α–blockers (Doxazosin): May be useful in patients with BPH. Higher rates of
heart failure compared to thiazides (ALLHAT Trial)
Common side-effects: Headache, fatigue, erectile dysfunction
Clonidine: May be useful in patients with PTSD, ADHD
Common side-effects: Rebound hypertension (use caution in forgetful
patients, consider use of patch but more expensive)
Hydralazine: Dosed multiple times per day
Common side-effects: Tachycardia, fluid retention

CLINICAL PEARLS
Blood pressure goals must be individualized based on patient factors and consider
competing guidelines for applicability to each patient
Home blood pressure monitoring is an important indicator of BP control, and should be
checked when able to confirm diagnosis prior to starting treatment if BP less than 160/100
Ensure correct BP readings through patient positioning and repeat measurements to avoid
overtreatment of HTN
SPRINT Trial—SBP goal of < 120 associated with lower CV mortality and CV events
compared to SBP goal of < 140, but also associated with higher rates of syncope,
hypotension, AKI, and electrolyte abnormalities. Be mindful of studied population before
generalizing results (non-DM, no previous CVA, high CV risk (average ASCVD risk
roughly 20%)
Consider a BP goal of 150/90 in patients above age 60 without DM or CKD, especially if
there is concern for antihypertensive side-effects
