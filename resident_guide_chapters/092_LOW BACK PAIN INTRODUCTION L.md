92. LOW BACK PAIN
INTRODUCTION
Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common ambulatory complaints, with a 60–70%
lifetime incidence
LBP is the second most common cause of repeat office visits and the most common cause
of disability in patients under the age of 45
Red flags include: Age > 65 years-old, previous cancer history, unexplained weight loss,
fever, chronic infection, failure to improve after 1 month of therapy or duration of pain
> 1 month, nighttime pain, history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), trauma, history of
peripheral vascular disease, progressive motor or sensory deficits
For such a common problem, there are relatively few randomized, controlled trials to
guide management. Most patients improve with conservative management and do not
require diagnostic studies
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
Goals are to exclude systemic disease, characterize neurologic deficits, determine the
etiology of LBP, differentiate mechanical vs. non-mechanical pain, and evaluate for social or
psychological distress which may amplify or prolong the pain
History
Determine mechanism of injury, onset, and duration
Location and character of pain
Constancy (intermittent, constant, or waxing and waning)
Distribution (focal, extended, or radiating)
Aggravating and relieving factors (positional, etc.)
Presence (or absence) of radicular pain
Bowel or bladder dysfunction
Fever, weight loss, trauma, morning stiffness
Previous drug and therapeutic treatments (and their success or failure)
Life stressors
History of cancer, IVDU, immune suppression, spinal procedures
Physical exam
Posture and gait, pain behavior
Palpation of spinous processes and paraspinal musculature
Motor examination includes hip flexion (L2), knee extension (L4), ankle dorsiflexion
(L4,5), great toe dorsiflexion (L5), and ankle plantarflexion (S1)
—GRADING OF MUSCLE STRENGTH—
Grade 0: No movement
Grade 1: Trace movement without joint motion
Grade 2: Partially or fully moves body part with gravity eliminated
Grade 3: Completely moves body part against gravity
Grade 4: Moves body part against moderate resistance through full range of motion
Grade 5: Normal
Reflex examination includes patella or knee jerk (L4), medial hamstring (L5) and
Achilles or ankle (S1)
Sensory examination: Anterior/inner thigh (L2,3), lateral thigh or medial leg (L4),
lateral leg and dorsal foot (L5), posterior leg (S1). If constrained by time, ask patient
to point out areas

Examine lumbosacral range of motion, including extension, flexion, side-bending, and
rotation. Palpate of the low back and buttocks can help localize pain and detect tender
or “trigger points”
Straight leg raise test: Passive elevation of the lower extremity on the symptomatic
side to less than 60° while the patient is supine; the test is positive with resulting
radicular pain. Sensitivity is 95%, specificity is 40%
Abdominal exam for organomegaly, pulsatile abdominal mass
Look for Waddell signs (at least 3 indicate a psychologic or non-organic component of
the pain)
Inappropriate or widespread tenderness
Pain on simulated physical maneuvers
Inconsistent exam while patient is distracted
Regional non-anatomic distribution of pain or weakness
Overreaction to exam (excess moaning or grimacing)
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
Radiologic studies: If a careful history and physical exam indicate acute musculoskeletal/
radicular LBP in a patient age 20–50, radiologic imaging is unnecessary. It is not
recommended to obtain imaging until after 6 weeks of conservative and physical therapies
unless concerned for cauda equina syndrome, fracture, infection, or malignancy
Indications for radiographs
Trauma to exclude fracture
Possible neurologic deficits, fever, unexplained weight loss, history of cancer,
corticosteroid use or IVDU, or suspicion of serious underlying illness based on
“red flags” (See I. C., above). Note: If any of these diagnoses are being evaluated,
the sensitivity of plain x-rays is very poor and other diagnostic testing such as
CBC, ESR, or MRI should be considered
Indications for MRI
Suspicion of serious underlying cause of pain
Progression of symptoms despite conservative management
Prior to evaluation for surgery or epidural steroid injections
Note: MRI and clinical symptoms do not always correlate. Studies on
asymptomatic volunteers < 60 show that 22–54% have herniated or bulging disc
and the prevalence in patients > 60 is 36–79%
Bone scan: Indicated to evaluate osteomyelitis, neoplasm or occult fracture
Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG) assess the neurophysiologic status of the nerve fibers
but do have some limitations and are not helpful for acute back pain
Laboratory: As indicated to screen for serious underlying illness (See I. C. above)

MECHANICAL VERSUS NON-MECHANICAL
Mechanical/discogenic
Acute undetermined soft tissue injury (lumbosacral sprain): May present with
lumbosacral pain following a traumatic injury or possibly accompanied by a tearing
sensation while lifting
History and physical exam reveal no evidence of radiculopathy
Typically, nonspecific LBP (often referred to as lumbosacral strain) is that ⅓
substantially better at 1 week and ⅔at 7 weeks. Reoccurrences are common
Treatment
Avoid bed rest
NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and analgesics
Physical therapy emphasizes stretching hamstrings, gluteals, hip flexors, and
tensor fascia lata
Instruction on strengthening of extensor muscles (walking, jogging,
swimming) and proper lifting techniques
Acute discogenic LBP (herniated disc): Caused by either disruption of the annular
fibers of the disc or herniation of the disc with resulting nerve root impingement
(radiculopathy)
Radiculopathy almost always involves the L5 or S1 nerve root
The peak age for herniated disc disease is 30–55 years-old
History: Usually includes a previous episode of similar LBP that resolved
spontaneously in 3–5 days; patients often complain that pain is worse in a seated
position; occurs after lifting or trauma
The natural history of herniated disc is that most have partial or complete
resolution at 6 months
Treatment
In patients without progressive neuro deficit or cauda equina syndrome, use
conservative management for at least 1 month
Bed rest for no more than 2–3 days if patient is unable to ambulate
A steroid taper or NSAIDs to decrease inflammation and provide relief
Pain control
Physical therapy
Epidural steroid injections or surgery for patients who fail to improve with
conservative treatment
Chronic LBP: Most episodes of acute LBP respond by 10–12 weeks
Review the diagnosis to exclude systemic disease
Determine patient compliance with activity modifications and medications
Review the type of treatment patient is receiving in physical therapy
Screen for an underlying depression (See Chapter 107, Depression) or myofascial
pain/fibromyalgia
Non-mechanical
Cancer: Multiple myeloma, metastatic disease to bone from lung, prostate, kidney, or
breast
Gynecologic
Renal: UTI/pyelonephritis, renal colic, renal artery occlusion
Rheumatoid arthritis: Morning stiffness > 1 hour, improvement with exercise, gradual
onset of symptoms, and pain duration > 3 months
Gastrointestinal: PUD, pancreatitis
Osteoporosis/compression fractures: See Chapter 86, Common Fractures
Vascular: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
MANAGEMENT
Medications: NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and analgesics (narcotic or non-narcotic) may be
effective (See Chapter 80, Nonopioid Medications for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain)
