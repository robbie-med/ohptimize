35. ACUTE BRONCHITIS
GENERAL
Definition:A respiratory tract infection which causes inflammation of the trachea-
bronchial tree
Approximately 90–95% of cases are viral in origin
The cough lasts on average 2–3 weeks (pooled average 18 days). May persist for weeks
to months after infection has resolved due to inflammatory changes. Up to 25% of patients
may have a cough which persists longer than 1 month
Up to 60% of patients have decreased FEV and peak flows to less than 80% of predicted
Cigarette smokers are predisposed to the development of acute bronchitis secondary to
direct injury to airway epithelium, less cilia present, and delayed mucociliary clearance.
Smokers have infections that are more frequent, more severe, and last longer
ETIOLOGY
Viral (most common): Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza, RSV, Adenovirus, and Rhinovirus
Bacteria: Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis,
Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, or Haemophilus influenzae (most common
cause in smokers)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Reactive airway disease, asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis
Occupational exposures, inhalation injuries
Upper respiratory infection, common cold, sinusitis, influenza, pneumonia, pertussis
Congestive heart failure
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
Lung cancer
Foreign body
CLINICAL FEATURES
Symptoms may vary depending on the etiologic agent and host factors including age,
smoking history, and comorbidities such as asthma and/or COPD
Common signs and symptoms
Cough, initially dry and non-productive, then productive of mucopurulent sputum
Preceding URI with sore throat, myalgias, chills, malaise, coryza, etc.
Fever, typically only present for first few days of illness
Fatigue and malaise
Headache
Occasional dyspnea, rales, rhonchi, wheezing
DIAGNOSIS: Usually based on symptoms and physical exam. Culture of the sputum is
generally unhelpful. Exclude pneumonia and non-pulmonary causes. Chest x-ray to exclude
pneumonia should be reserved for patients with abnormal vital signs or abnormal lung exam
findings. Consider influenza or pertussis swab based on history and findings
TREATMENT: Symptomatic
Cough suppression: Dextromethorphan reduces cough by 8–10 bouts per 30 minutes.
Codeine and benzonatate have not been shown to be helpful. Honey has been shown to be
helpful in children over 1 year of age

ID
Expectorants/Mucolytics: Guaifenesin has been shown to be effective for reducing cough
severity, frequency, and sputum thickness
Encourage smoking cessation if patient smokes
β2-agonists: Not been shown to provide benefit except in adults with wheezing at time of
exam
Increased hydration: No evidence to support patients increasing fluid intake for acute
respiratory infections
Antibiotics
Most cases are viral, but antibiotics (antibiotics) are very frequently prescribed,
usually because of physicians’ perceptions of patients’ expectations. At least one study
has shown that when physicians explain the diagnosis and rationale for treatment,
patients who did not receive antibiotics were as satisfied as those who did. Calling the
illness a “chest cold” is associated with increased patient acceptance and willingness to
forego antibiotics
Studies of antibiotic use show possible reduction in duration of cough and feeling ill
(1 day or less reduction). There was no change in night cough, productive cough, or
activity limitation. Patients treated with antibiotics had more adverse effects including
nausea/vomiting, headache, skin rash, or vaginitis. The number needed to harm was 5.
The CDC recommends against treating acute bronchitis with antibiotics
CLINICAL PEARLS
Antibiotics are prescribed at 70–90% of office visits for acute bronchitis despite most
episodes being viral in etiology
Pulmonary function testing for asthma may yield false positive results in patients with
acute bronchitis due to transient PFT obstructive abnormalities
Consider pertussis diagnosis in patients with cough > 2 weeks
Avoid OTC antihistamines and antitussives in children under 4
Most effective symptomatic agents appear to be dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, and honey
