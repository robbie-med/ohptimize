97. CONTACT DERMATITIS
DEFINITION: Acute, subacute or chronic inflammation of the epidermis and dermis caused
by external agents, toxicity or an allergic reaction and characterized by pruritus or burning
TYPES
Allergic contact dermatitis: Cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction
Irritant contact: Due to inflammation from a local toxic effect of a chemical on the skin
Contact photodermatitis: A type of allergic contact dermatitis triggered by ultraviolet
light
Contact urticaria: Wheal and flare reaction—may be allergic (IgE) or nonallergic
HISTORY
Family history of atopy
Exposure history: Inquire about new exposures to common irritants (listed below)
Nickel: Jewelry, metal clothing fasteners, coins
Potassium Dichromate: Cement, paper, leather, metal paint, detergent
Paraphenylenediamine: Hair dyes, ink, fur dyes, radiographic fluid
Chrome
Formaldehydes: Permanent press fabrics, shampoos, smoke
Rhus plants: Poison ivy, oak and sumac
Duration of lesions
Previous successful or unsuccessful therapy
PHYSICAL EXAM
Acute contact dermatitis: Vesicles and/or bullae filled with clear fluid or erythematous,
edematous skin
Subacute contact dermatitis: Erythema, minimal edema, multiple papules
Chronic contact dermatitis: Lichenified plaques with minimal erythema, minimal edema,
possible scales
Rhus dermatitis (poison ivy dermatitis—See below)
Attempt to correlate the location of the eruption with exposure (e.g., dermatitis due to
nickel in earrings is present on the earlobes)
Evaluate for secondary infection
PATCH TESTING
Patch testing may be performed in patients who are suspected of having contact allergy
but no allergen can be elicited by history. This should be done after the episode of
dermatitis has resolved
Apply patch test to skin on back and occlude for 48 hours
Interpret in 72 hours
Positive test with the development of erythema, papules, vesicles
MANAGEMENT
Identify and eliminate the offending agent, i.e., remove exposure
Wet compresses for oozing and vesiculation
Wash BID with soap and water
Burrow’s solution: Aluminum Acetate tablets in water (1:40) for wet compresses, then
apply steroid cream to suppress inflammation

DERM
Topical steroid cream: Use a stronger cream for areas of thick skin (back of arms, palms,
etc.) (See Chapter 100, Topical Steroids, for a listing of different steroid creams.) Do not
use fluorinated steroid creams on face as it may result in depigmentation of skin
Systemic (oral) corticosteroids for extensive dermatitis. Begin with Prednisone 1–2mg/
kg/day (40–60mg max) given daily or as a divided dose and taper over 2–3 weeks. An easy
taper is to give: Prednisone 10mg. Give #30. Use 4 pills per day for 3 days, 3 pills per day
for 3 days, 2 pills per day for 3 days and 1 pill for 3 days. Shorter courses may result in a
rebound phenomenon
Symptomatic medications
Adults
Hydroxyzine (Atarax): 25mg PO TID–4 ×/day
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl): 25–50mg PO TID–4 ×/day
Children
Younger than 6 years: Hydroxyzine (10mg/5cc), 25–50mg/day PO in divided
doses, ≥6 years: 50–100mg/day divided TID
Benadryl: 12.5mg/5mL, used in children > 20lbs; 2–6 years: 6.25mg every 4 hours
not to exceed 25mg/24 hours; 6–12 years: 12.5–25mg every 4–6 hours
RHUS DERMATITIS: POISON IVY, POISON SUMAC, ETC.
Hypersensitivity reaction from exposure to rhus plants either directly (by contact with a
plant) or indirectly (by contact with something which has been exposed to the plant and
carries its oils—clothing, gloves, pets, shoelaces, etc.)
Exanthem develops over 48–72 hours and consists of linear vesicles (with direct
exposure) or grouped vesicles (with indirect exposure) which may be weeping. The fluid
inside the vesicles is not contagious as it does not contain the plant oils
Complications: Infection
Management
Wash lesions BID with soap and water
Cold washcloth or shower will help decrease itching
Symptomatic medications: See VI. G. above
Topical steroid cream: See VI. E. above
Oral steroids: Indicated for most rhus rashes unless small area (topical) or
asymptomatic or contraindicated. See VI. F. above
Cut fingernails short in children
Patients (especially children) should be educated in identification of plants
CLINICAL PEARLS
A rash from poison ivy that seems to be spreading may be caused by repeated exposure to
the plant, exposure to clothes/pets which bear the oils, or different sensitivities of the skin
which has been exposed (arm vs. face)
Contact dermatitis is one of the most common reasons for worker’s compensation claims
for skin disease
