112. VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURES
GENERAL
Vertebral compression fractures are the most common complication of osteoporosis
40% of Caucasian women over age 50 will have a compression fracture in their lifetime
Approximately 70,000 vertebral compression fractures result in hospitalization each year
Vertebral compression fractures are associated with an increased mortality
corresponding to the number of vertebrae involved
30% of symptomatic patients who seek treatment do not respond to nonsurgical
treatments
HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM
Two-thirds of patients are asymptomatic at time of diagnosis, but those who present
with pain report sudden onset of localized pain in relationship to atraumatic activities
(bending forward, standing from seated, vigorous coughing or sneezing)
Risk factors: Advancing age, osteopenia or osteoporosis, history of falls or prior vertebral
compression fracture, low peak bone mass, low body weight, Vitamin D deficiency, use of
corticosteroids more than 5 mg daily for 3 months, cigarette smoking, drinking more than
two alcoholic drinks per day for women and more than three alcoholic drinks per day in men
Physical exam
Height: Loss of height of greater than 3cm increases likelihood of vertebral fracture
and should be evaluated with a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph
Focal kyphosis or loss of lumbar lordosis
Localized boney tenderness at the involved vertebral level
TESTING
Plain radiographs: May demonstrate classic “wedge” fracture indicative of loss of
anterior vertebral body height. The most frequent site is thoracolumbar junction then
midthoracic spine
Acute fracture: Well-demarcated fracture lines or discontinuity of cortical margin
Chronic facture: Sclerosis of fracture lines, dense cortical margin, osteophytes
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): To diagnose acute vertebral compression fractures
with normal plain radiographs
Useful for identifying minimally compressed fractures
Differentiation of acute from chronic fractures
Diagnosis of compression fractures caused by tumor or infection
Computed tomography (CT) with thin cuts: Helpful in evaluating for unstable crush
fractures
Bone scintigraphy: Use limited by radionuclide uptake that may persist for up to 2 years
after acute fracture
MANAGEMENT: Most patients have predictable pain improvement over 6–8 weeks, but
some have persistent pain and disability
Nonsurgical management
Prevention: Focusing on attainment of peak bone mass and prevention of
postmenopausal bone loss. See Chapter 85, Osteoporosis
Bracing and rehabilitation
Continuous hyperextension bracing: May be beneficial in the first 6–8 weeks as
pain improves; however, the evidence is limited to support bracing. Often poorly
tolerated. Efficacy in preventing further vertebral collapse not established

Rehabilitation: Should commence after pain resolution. Focus on fall prevention
and education. Back extension exercises are superior to abdominal flexion
exercises in lowering incidence of new fractures
Medications
Pain relief—First line agents: Acetaminophen, salicylates, or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medications. Reserve narcotics for those who fail the former
medications. See Chapter 80, Nonopioid Medications for Chronic Noncancer Pain
Salmon calcitonin
First-line treatment for reduction of acute bone pain
Significant reduction in pain as early as 1 week into treatment and the benefit
may last for 4 weeks
Dose: Calcitonin nasal spray (Miacalcin)—1 spray (200 IU) alternating
nostrils daily
Lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm): One patch topically to affected areas for 12 hours
on, then 12 hours off
Surgical management: Vertebral augmentation procedures are indicated for patients with
an acute MRI-confirmed vertebral fracture with debilitating pain or substantial functional
limitations after at least 3 weeks of conservative therapy
Vertebroplasty: To improve strength and stability of fractured vertebra
Indication: Pain should be localized and attributable to the fractured vertebra.
Success rates for pain relief and functional improvement between 78% and 90%
Contraindications: Severe wedge deformity fractures, comminuted burst fractures,
spinal canal compromise greater than 20%, myelopathy, inability to lie prone,
severe cardiopulmonary disease, uncorrected coagulopathy, inability to localize
source of pain, allergy to cement or radiopaque dye, and local or systemic
infection
Technique: Injection of a mixture of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and barium
into the involved vertebra using fluoroscopic guidance
Complications: PMMA leakage, radiculopathy, cord compression, postoperative
infection, worsened pain, rib fractures, pneumothorax. Death secondary to
pulmonary embolization
Kyphoplasty: To restore vertebral body height and improve strength
Indications: Same as for vertebroplasty. Rates of pain relief and functional
improvement equivalent to vertebroplasty
Contraindications and complications: See Vertebroplasty, B. 1. above
Technique: Similar to vertebroplasty. In this procedure an inflatable balloon
or tamp is inserted into vertebral body to create a low-pressure cavity for the
injection of PMMA
Advantages: Improved deformity correction and decreased potential for cement
leakage. Restoration of vertebral height however does not correlate with pain relief
or functional improvement
Disadvantages: Cost-effectiveness less than for vertebroplasty. Success rates may
depend on the age of fracture
CLINICAL PEARLS
Vertebral compression fractures are associated with an increased mortality corresponding
to the number of vertebrae involved
Most patients will have pain improvement over 6–8 weeks
Salmon Calcitonin, Acetaminophen, salicylates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications are all first-line treatments for pain associated with vertebral compression
fractures
Based on current evidence, vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are indicated for patients with
debilitating pain after acute MRI-confirmed compression fracture or substantial functional
limitations after at least three weeks of conservative therapy
