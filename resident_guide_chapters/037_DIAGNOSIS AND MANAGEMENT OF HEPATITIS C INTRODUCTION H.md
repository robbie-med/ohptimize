37. DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS C
INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is one of the leading causes of
chronic hepatitis
In the U. S., an estimated 2.7–3.9 million people have chronic hepatitis C
Based on the adjusted data from the CDC, there were approximately 30,500 cases of acute
hepatitis C in 2014. About 55% to 85% of those with acute hepatitis C will remain HCV-
infected and the risk of developing cirrhosis ranges from 5 to 25% over a period of 25 to
30 years
Patients with cirrhosis can develop hepatic decompensation (30% over 10 years) as well
as hepatocellular carcinoma (1 to 3% per year)
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HCV INFECTION
Approximately 70–80% of people with acute hepatitis C do not have any symptoms of
the disease
Symptoms if present will usually appear within 2–6 weeks after being exposed to HCV.
The symptoms include
Fatigue
Myalgias
Joint pain
Fever
Nausea or poor appetite
Stomach pain
Itchy skin
Dark urine
Jaundice
Patients with chronic hepatitis C are typically asymptomatic until they develop chronic
liver disease
SCREENING FOR HCV INFECTION IN ADULTS
The USPSTF recommends screening in persons at high risk for infection and adults born
between 1945 and 1965
Persons at high risk for HCV infection include
Persons with past or current injection drug use, including those who injected only once
Persons with intranasal illicit drug use
Patients who have ever received long-term hemodialysis treatment
Recipients of clotting factor concentrates made before 1987
Recipients of blood transfusions or solid organ transplants before July 1992
Persons with known exposures to HCV, such as health care workers after needle sticks
involving HCV-positive blood
Recipients of blood or organs from a donor who later tested HCV-positive
All persons with HIV infection
Patients with signs or symptoms of liver disease (e.g., abnormal liver enzyme tests)
Children born to HCV-positive mothers (to avoid detecting maternal antibody, these
children should undergo anti-HCV antibody test after 18 months of age)
Persons who were ever incarcerated

DIAGNOSIS
Baseline labs for those with suspected hepatitis C infection
Complete blood cell count with differential
Liver function tests
Thyroid function studies
Screening tests for coinfection with HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV)
Screening for alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and depression
Testing for HCV virus
Antibody to HCV (anti-HCV)
Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA): Detected 4–10 weeks after infection and detects
97% of HCV after 6 months
Enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA)
Qualitative tests to detect presence or absence of virus (HCV RNA polymerase chain
reaction [PCR]): Detected 2–3 weeks after exposure
Quantitative tests to detect amount (titer) of virus (HCV RNA PCR)
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Imaging
Acute
Evaluation of elevated AST and ALT may include right upper quadrant ultrasound
or CT scan to evaluate for hepatic steatosis (“fatty liver”)
If bilirubin is elevated, right upper quadrant ultrasound is warranted to assure there
is no bile duct dilatation. If bile ducts are dilated, further imaging includes CT,
MRI or ERCP/MRCP depending on the pathology suspected
Chronic
Imaging is helpful in the assessment of chronic changes of hepatitis C which
include fibrosis, cirrhosis (end stage fibrosis), development of portal hypertension
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Imaging, particularly ultrasound can be used to
direct a liver biopsy for pathology confirmation of cirrhosis
Frequency of ultrasound: Initially as well as at 6-month intervals
Positive HCV status warrants the evaluation of chronic liver disease. The preferred
approach is to assess the degree of fibrosis on liver biopsy, using a validated staging
system such as the Ishak, IASL, METAVIR or Batts-Ludwig staging systems
MANAGEMENT
AASLD Practice Guidelines recommend two treatment goals
Sustained eradication of HCV (i.e., sustained virologic response [SVR]), which is
defined as the persistent absence of HCV RNA in serum 6 months or more after
completing antiviral treatment
Prevent progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and decompensated
liver disease requiring liver transplantation

ID
Treatment is widely recommended for patients with elevated serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels who meet the following criteria
Age greater than 18 years
Positive HCV antibody and serum HCV RNA test results
Compensated liver disease (e.g., no hepatic encephalopathy or ascites)
Acceptable hematologic and biochemical indices (hemoglobin at least 13g/dL for men
and 12g/dL for women; neutrophil count > 1500/mm3, serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL)
Willingness to be treated and to adhere to treatment requirements
No contraindications for treatment
TREATMENT
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have created a website on HCV guidelines
(See links in F. below) to facilitate easy, fast, and up-to-date access to important
information on the treatment of HCV infection
Note that the AASLD/IDSA is a “living” document that is rapidly updated as data from
peer-reviewed research become available. When treating patients with HCV infection,
clinicians are encouraged to refer to this website for the latest treatment information
The AASLD/IDSA guidelines provide treatment options for treatment-naïve and
treatment-experienced adults. A specific treatment regimen is then selected based on
patient genotype and with or without cirrhosis
Table 1 provides AASLD/IDSA recommended hepatitis C treatment options for
treatment-naïve adults with cirrhosis
Table 2 provides ASSLD/IDSA recommended hepatitis C treatment options for
treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis
Refer to AASLD/IDSA HCV guidelines for retreatment of persons in whom prior therapy
failed
Consider patient-specific factors, such as drug interactions, adverse effects, adherence,
cost or payor coverage when choosing a regimen.

MONITORING
Lab evaluation for all patients starting treatment to be obtained 12 weeks before starting
therapy
Complete blood count (CBC)
International normalized ratio (INR)
Hepatic function panel (albumin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels)
Calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
Monitoring during treatment
After 4 weeks and as clinically indicated
Complete blood count (CBC)
Creatinine level
Calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
Hepatic function panel are recommended
Patients on Interferon therapy
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every 12 weeks
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
10-fold increase in ALT at week 4 should prompt discontinuation of therapy
Any increase in ALT of less than 10-fold at week 4 and accompanied by any
weakness, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or significantly increased bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, or international normalized ratio, should also prompt discontinuation
of therapy
Asymptomatic increases in ALT of less than 10-fold elevated at week 4 should be
closely monitored and repeated at week 6 and week 8. If levels remain persistently
elevated, consideration should be given to discontinuation of therapy
Quantitative HCV viral load
After 4 weeks of therapy and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy
Can be considered at the end of treatment and 24 weeks or longer following the
completion of therapy
For HBsAg+ patients who are not already on HBV suppressive therapy, monitoring
of HBV DNA levels during and immediately after DAA therapy for HCV is
recommended and antiviral treatment for HBV should be given if treatment criteria for
HBV are met
Recommended follow-up for patients who achieve a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)
For patients who do not have advanced fibrosis (those with METAVIR stage F0-F2),
recommended follow-up is the same as if they were never infected with HCV
Assessment for HCV recurrence or reinfection is recommended only if the patient has
ongoing risk for HCV infection or otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction develops
Quantitative HCV RNA assay rather than an anti-HCV serology test is recommended
to test for HCV recurrence or reinfection
Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma with twice-yearly ultrasound examination is
recommended for patients with advanced fibrosis (METAVIR stage F3 or F4)
Recommended monitoring for patients in whom treatment failed to achieve SVR
Disease progression assessment every 6 months to 12 months with a hepatic function
panel, complete blood count (CBC), and international normalized ratio (INR) is
recommended
Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasound examination every 6 months is
recommended for patients with advanced fibrosis (METAVIR stage F3 or F4)
Endoscopic screening for esophageal varices is recommended if cirrhosis is present
Continue to monitor patients for drug interactions, adverse effects, adherence, cost or
payor coverage
