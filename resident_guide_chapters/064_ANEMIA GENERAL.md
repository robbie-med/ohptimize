64. ANEMIA
GENERAL: Hemoglobin < 12g/dL in women and < 13g/dL in men (WHO criteria).
Classically divided into microcytic (MCV < 83 mcm3), normocytic (MCV 83–100 mcm3), or
macrocytic (MCV > 100 mcm3)
PHYSIOLOGY OF NORMAL IRON METABOLISM
Iron is required for hemoglobin and DNA synthesis. Daily dietary intake of iron in U.S.
is approximately 10–20mg/day
Most iron absorption takes place in the small intestine
Mucosal iron is stored as ferritin and the mucosal transport protein is transferrin
Iron storage (as ferritin) is primarily found in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and skeletal
muscle
HISTORY
Many patients are asymptomatic: Patients may experience fatigue, weakness,
lightheadedness, headache, irritability, palpitations, paresthesias, hot/cold intolerance, gait
disturbances, sore tongue, brittle nails, or pica (desire to eat dirt, ice, paint). Inquire about
sources of bleeding such as rectal bleeding or heavy periods, and unexpected weight loss
Alcohol use
Medications: Zidovudine (AZT), Dilantin, Phenobarbital, OCPs, Sulfa, Trimethoprim,
Colchicine, Neomycin
Medical history including history of malabsorption syndromes or inflammatory bowel
disease
Surgeries: Partial or total gastrectomy predisposes patient to Vitamin B12 deficiency—
pernicious anemia
Chemical or radiation exposure (myelodysplasia)
Diet: Strict vegetarians/vegans are susceptible to developing Vitamin B12 deficiency;
patients with a high carbohydrate diet (and nothing else) are susceptible to folate
deficiency
PHYSICAL EXAM: Physical exam may be normal or may include murmur, CHF, papillary
atrophy of the tongue, glossitis, brittle nails, gait disturbance (Vitamin B12 deficiency) or
hepatosplenomegaly/ascites/jaundice (liver disease), or signs of chronic alcohol abuse
EVALUATION: There may be considerable overlap, but the evaluation is generally initiated
by first determining if the anemia is microcytic (MCV < 80 mcm3), macrocytic (MCV > 100
mcm3), or normocytic (MCV 80–100 mcm3)
Microcytic anemia
Differential diagnosis
Iron deficiency anemia (the most common cause of microcytosis)
(Anemia of) chronic disease
Thalassemia
Sideroblastic anemia
Lead toxicity
Labs
Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin
WBC (low count suggests marrow production problem and a high count could
278
GEN
suggest infection or leukemia)
Peripheral smear: Burr cells (chronic renal failure), spherocytes (hemolytic
diseases), dysplastic changes, basophilic stippling (thalassemia, iron deficiency,
lead poisoning), Howell-Jolly bodies (asplenia, pernicious anemia, severe iron
deficiency)
Reticulocyte count: If result is < 1%, then this suggests inadequate production. If
result is > 1%, then calculate the reticulocyte index (% reticulocytes × patient’s
hematocrit/normal hematocrit). Reticulocyte index should be > 2 with the presence
of anemia indicating the body is attempting to compensate

Etiology of iron deficiency anemia
Blood loss: Gastrointestinal (ulcer, malignancy), menstruation, blood donation
Decreased ingestion or increased requirements (pregnancy, lactation)
Decreased absorption: Malabsorption syndromes, partial gastrectomy
Pulmonary hemosiderosis, polycythemia
Management of iron deficiency anemia
Determine etiology and direct initial therapy toward correction
Evaluation of the GI tract in adults (See below)
Adults: Numerous forms of oral iron are available over the counter such as ferrous
gluconate and ferrous sulfate. Despite differences in dosing, all have been shown
to be equally effective as long as taken consistently; children: 3–6mg elemental
Fe/kg/day PO divided TID. Side-effects: Cramping, nausea, constipation and/or
diarrhea
Evaluating the gastrointestinal tract in iron deficiency anemia
Idiopathic iron deficiency anemia in adults is commonly from blood loss in GI
tract—obtain fecal occult blood test
History and physical exam directed toward potential areas of blood loss
Endoscopic evaluation (EGD or colonoscopy) depending on patient’s symptoms
For asymptomatic adults, perform colonoscopy first
Macrocytic anemia
Differential diagnosis
Alcohol abuse
Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
Hemolysis or bleeding
Liver disease
Hypothyroidism
Myelodysplasia
Chemotherapeutic agents or other drugs
Labs (as indicated)
WBC and peripheral smear: Target cells (liver disease), hyposegmented cells
(myelodysplasia), hypersegmented cells (Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency)
279
GEN
Vitamin B12 and folate (RBC folate is more reliable)
Reticulocytes
TSH and free T4
LFTs
Consider bone marrow aspirate
Management: Directed toward underlying disorder
Causes of Vitamin B12 deficiency include decreased intake (strict vegan),
decreased absorption (pernicious anemia, gastrectomy, gastric atrophy, Crohn’s
disease, ileal resection, celiac disease, tropical sprue, chronic pancreatitis, bacterial
over-growth) and decreased utilization (nitrous oxide inhalation, inborn errors of
metabolism)
Treatment of Vitamin B12 deficiency includes oral therapy with Vitamin B12
1,000–2,000 micrograms PO daily (equivalent to parenteral therapy) or IM therapy
by 1mg IM once daily for 1 week, then 1mg once weekly for 1 month, and then
1mg once a month indefinitely
Causes of folate deficiency include decreased intake, decreased absorption
(tropical sprue, celiac disease, short gut syndrome), medications (Dilantin,
Phenobarbital, alcohol, OCs, Trimethoprim, Sulfa), increased demands
(pregnancy, infancy, hemolytic anemia)
Treatment of folate deficiency: Folate 1mg PO daily for 1–4 months. Note:
Ensure that concomitant Vitamin B12 deficiency does not exist since neurologic
symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency may worsen if treated only with folic acid
Normocytic anemia
Differential diagnosis
Early iron deficiency anemia
Anemia of chronic disease
Chronic renal insufficiency
Endocrine disorders: Thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency
Bone marrow failure: Radiation, drugs (chemotherapy), viruses (HIV, Hepatitis B)
Bone marrow replacement: Metastatic cancer, myelofibrosis, leukemia
Normocytic anemia with elevated RDW may indicate multiple etiologies
Labs (as indicated)
WBC and peripheral smear
Vitamin B12 and folate (RBC folate is more reliable)
Reticulocytes
TSH and free T4
LFTs
Consider bone marrow aspirate
CLINICAL PEARLS
Most common causes of anemia in the elderly are anemia of chronic disease and iron
deficiency anemia
Neurologic symptoms in patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency may precede the onset of
anemia
Patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency may have normocytic or microcytic anemia
Full term newborns have a 6 month supply of iron; therefore, iron deficiency is rarely a
cause of anemia in children < 6 months
G6PD deficiency is present in an estimated 12% of black males and 2% of black females
