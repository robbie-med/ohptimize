50. HEMATURIA
DEFINITION: The presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine
INDICATIONS FOR WORKING-UP HEMATURIA
> 3 RBCs/HPF on 2 of 3 clean catch specimens
1 episode of gross hematuria
1 episode of large microhematuria (> 100 RBCs/HPF)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Most common etiologies include UTI, BPH, renal calculi
ABC mnemonic
A = Anatomic (renal cysts, AV malformation, obstruction with hydronephrosis, BPH)
B = Boulders (nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria)
C = Cancer (renal cell, bladder, prostate in adults; Wilms’ tumor or leukemia in children)
D = Drugs (prescribed and illicit drugs)
E = Exercise (contact and noncontact sports)
F = Familial or foreign body (indwelling catheter, trauma, Alport’s syndrome—family
history of deafness and renal disease)
G = Glomerulonephritis (post-strep, Goodpasture’s, SLE, Berger’s, Henoch-Schönlein
purpura)
H = Hematology (hemoglobinopathies, coagulopathies)
I = Infection (bacterial, viral or fungal)
HISTORY
Genitourinary history
Dysuria, nocturia, or increased frequency
Vaginal or penile discharge (obtain sexual history)
Recent trauma or vigorous exercise
Previous urologic surgery
Flank pain or prior nephrolithiasis
Last menstrual period
Painful vs. painless hematuria
Etiologies of painful hematuria: UTI, endometriosis, nephrolithiasis, papillary
necrosis, obstruction, passage of clots
Etiologies of painless hematuria: Bladder tumor, staghorn calculus, polycystic kidneys,
hydronephrosis, sickle cell anemia, hypercalciuria, anticoagulation
Recent infections
Fever, sore throat, or rash
Tooth extraction or other invasive procedures
Recent travel (schistosomiasis)
Family history
Renal disease
Sickle cell anemia
Deafness (Alport’s syndrome—familial nephritis)
Bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand’s disease, Vitamin K deficiency, liver
disease)
Medications: Look for Cyclophosphamide, Warfarin (Coumadin), NSAIDs, Aspirin, PCN
Risk factors for urologic cancer: Age > 40, tobacco use, exposure to rubber or aniline
dyes, schistosomiasis, pelvic radiation, family history of urologic cancer, or analgesic
abuse

PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Temperature and vital signs
Oropharynx: Tonsillar enlargement
Abdomen: Masses, hepatomegaly, or suprapubic tenderness
Back: CVA tenderness
Extremities: Supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy
Skin: Rash or ecchymoses
Rectal: Masses and prostate size, guaiac stool
Pelvic: urethral masses, atrophic vaginitis or uterine source
EVALUATING HEMATURIA
Directed by results of the history and physical exam: Processes which may yield a false
positive dipstick result include contamination of the urine specimen with menstrual blood,
dehydration, exercise, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) or vitamins, high concentrations of oxidants,
foods (beets, rhubarb, fava beans, blackberries), medications (Rifampin, Pyridium, Quinine),
and Porphyria
Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria > 3 RBCs/HBF
Assess for UTI or other benign cause
Complete UTI treatment, repeat UA 6 weeks after treatment. If negative, no additional
work-up needed. If microscopic hematuria persists, obtain renal function testing as
outlined below
Asymptomatic gross hematuria
Obtain UA and screening chemistries (See below)
Obtain radiologic study and obtain urologic consult for cystoscopy
Laboratory as history dictates
Urinalysis +/- culture and sensitivity
Pyuria, WBC casts (indicates infection)
Proteinuria, RBC casts (indicates glomerular disease)
Screening chemistries, as clinically indicated
BUN, creatinine, electrolytes
CBC, platelets, PT/PTT
PSA if indicated
If evidence of glomerular disease (i.e., presence of proteinuria or RBC casts)
Serum ANA, Anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane—Wegener’s disease)
C3, C4, ASO titers (post-strep), ESR, and serum protein electrophoresis
24 hour urine for protein and CrCl
If the microscopic examination indicates an absence of RBCs then an evaluation
for hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria should be initiated
Radiology
Multiphasic CT: Non contrast phase to evaluate for hydronephrosis or urinary calculi,
and a contrast phase to evaluate for pyelonephritis or cancerous lesions
Renal ultrasound: Good for evaluation of kidney (cystic or solid masses or
hydronephrosis) but limited evaluation of ureteral disease
Intravenous pyelography (IVP)—rarely used in favor of CT
Consider ultrasound if contrast nephropathy is a concern
Cystoscopy: Useful for evaluating the lower urinary tract and recommended for all
patients with asymptomatic hematuria
Pathologic evaluation
Urinary cytology is not routinely recommended and may only be useful if risk factors
for carcinoma in situ are present. is no longer recommended
FOLLOW-UP EXAMINATIONS
Patients with a negative initial work-up will need close follow-up
Urologic cancer has been found on follow-up exam in 1–3% of patients with microscopic
hematuria and 18% of patients with recurrent gross hematuria
The following should be considered as long as hematuria persists
215
LABS
If hematuria persists after negative initial work-up, continue to screen annually for 2
years after, and if remains positive repeat anatomic evaluation within 3–5 years
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients with gross hematuria have approximately 5 times the yield of life-threatening
conditions when compared to those with microhematuria
Hematuria will be present in about 85% of patients with renal stones
Serratia marcescens may cause a “red diaper” in healthy infants. Performing a UA proves
the absence of hemoglobin in the urine
Consider factitious hematuria (Münchausen’s disease) in patients with persistent
undiagnosed hematuria
Pyridium may cause a red-orange discoloration of alkaline urine
