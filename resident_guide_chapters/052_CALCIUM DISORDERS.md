52. CALCIUM DISORDERS
— PART ONE: HYPERCALCEMIA —
DEFINITION: Total calcium > 10.5mg/dL or ionized calcium > 5.3mg/dL. False positives
may be caused by hemoconcentration during blood collection or elevation in serum proteins,
particularly albumin
ETIOLOGY
Malignancy
Osteolytic hypercalcemia: Tumor cell products, such as cytokines, act locally to
stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. Occurs with extensive bone involvement by
tumor, usually due to breast cancer, myeloma, and lymphoma
Humoral hypercalcemia: Tumor products act systemically to stimulate bone resorption
and to decrease calcium excretion. Most often caused by squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung, head and neck, or esophagus, or by renal, bladder, or ovarian cancer
Primary hyperparathyroidism: Most common etiology in ambulatory care with annual
incidence of 2 in 1000. 85% of cases are due to an adenoma of a single gland, 15% to
hyperplasia of all 4 glands, and 1% to parathyroid carcinoma
Sarcoidosis (occurs secondary to increased absorption of calcium) and other
granulomatous diseases
Paget’s disease
Immobilization (due to suppression of the parathyroid-vitamin axis)
Vitamin D intoxication (due to increased absorption of calcium) and milk-alkali
syndrome
Medications: Thiazide diuretics (increased renal reabsorption of calcium) and Lithium
Other causes: Addison’s disease, renal failure, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia,
hyperthyroidism, Vitamin A intoxication, disseminated SLE, pheochromocytoma,
prolonged immobilization
Multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) syndromes
MEN I: Parathyroid, pituitary and pancreatic islet cell adenoma
MEN IIA: Hyperparathyroid, pheochromocytoma, medullary cell CA of the thyroid
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM: Most patients are asymptomatic at time of diagnosis.
Symptoms vary with degree of hypercalcemia and rapidity of development, but usually evident
when serum calcium > 12mg/dL
General: Weakness, fatigue, pruritus, hypertension, myopathy, weight loss, night sweats
(malignancy)
Duration of symptoms (primary hyperparathyroidism is usually etiology of symptoms
present > 6 months without obvious cause)
Diet: Intake of milk and antacids (milk-alkali syndrome), thiazides, Vitamin A or D,
Lithium
Evidence of neoplasm: (e.g., breast or ovarian) Ectopic soft tissue calcification (may be
seen when calcium levels rise > 13mg/dL)
CNS: Confusion, depression, psychosis, stupor, coma, headache, hyporeflexia, hypotonia,
apathy, mental retardation (infants)
GI: Constipation, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain (pancreatitis, PUD)
GU: Nephrolithiasis, nocturia, polyuria, renal failure (may be seen when calcium levels
rise > 13mg/dL)
220
LABS
Musculoskeletal: Bone pain (metastatic disease, multiple myeloma), deformities,
fractures, myopathy, pseudogout, muscle atrophy, bone pain with palpation, proximal
muscle weakness
Eye: Band keratopathy (found in medial and lateral margin of cornea)
Family history: MEN syndromes, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
Medications: Thiazide diuretic
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Lab tests
CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine (renal insufficiency)
Ionized calcium, albumin, phosphate, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase
24 hour urine calcium
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level: Elevated in more than 90% of patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism. Serum PTH levels are suppressed in patients with hypercalcemia
due to malignancy or other causes (except familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia which
is distinguished by documenting low urinary calcium clearance)
1,25–dihydroxyvitamin D level (with history of excessive ingestion of fat soluble
vitamins such as Vitamin D)
EKG: Shortening of QT interval, wide T waves, Digoxin sensitivity
Bone survey: May show subperiosteal bone resorption (PTH excess)
Bone scan: May show lytic lesions
MANAGEMENT: Differs between acute symptomatic hypercalcemia and chronic
hypercalcemia
Acute hypercalcemia: Symptomatic patients or those with serum calcium > 13mg/dL are
generally admitted for IV hydration therapy and observation, possibly with loop diuretics if
symptomatic and not hypovolemic. Consider emergent dialysis if life-threatening
Chronic hypercalcemia
High fluid intake: Should consume 3–5 L/day of fluids to increase renal calcium
excretion
Glucocorticoids: Inhibit intestinal absorption of calcium and increases urinary calcium
excretion. Effect usually evident after 48–72 hours. Effective in hypercalcemia due
to myeloma, hematologic malignancies, breast cancer, Vitamin D intoxication, and
sarcoidosis
Oral phosphates: Promotes calcium deposition in bone and soft tissue as well as
inhibiting GI calcium absorption. Use only in patients with normal renal function
Dose: 1–3g/day in divided doses
e.g., Neutra-Phos, Phos-tabs, Fleet Phospho-Soda
Side-effects: Diarrhea, nausea, soft tissue calcification
Dietary calcium restriction
Hypercalcemia due to specific conditions
Vitamin D toxicity: Treat with a low calcium diet (< 400mg/day). May take up to 2
months for effects of Vitamin D to subside
Sarcoidosis: Prednisone 10–20mg/day
Primary hyperparathyroidism: Parathyroidectomy is the only effective treatment.
Indications for surgery include symptoms of hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, bone
mass reduction greater than 2 standard deviations, age < 50, serum calcium > 12mg/
dL, GFR < 60, urine calcium > 400mg/24 hours
Malignancy: Interval between detection of hypercalcemia and death is often < 6
months
— PART TWO: HYPOCALCEMIA —
DEFINITION: Serum calcium < 9mg/dL or ionized calcium < 4.6mg/dL
ETIOLOGY
221
LABS
Hypoalbuminemia: Most common cause of low total serum calcium. Each decrease of
1g in serum albumin will decrease serum calcium by 0.8mg/dL, but will not change free
(ionized) calcium
Renal insufficiency:Decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, increased serum
phosphate levels cause calcium deposits in bone and soft tissue
Vitamin D deficiency: Malabsorption, decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,
inadequate intake
Hypomagnesemia: Decreased PTH secretion
Hyperphosphatemia
Hypoparathyroidism: Post-surgical most common, can also be familial or related to
systemic disease
Drugs: Pentamidine, Ketoconazole, Foscarnet, Cisplatin, Cytosine Arabinoside
Other: Acute pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, pseudohypo-
parathyroidism (PTH resistance), multiple citrated blood transfusions, sepsis
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Weakness, depression, lethargy
Neuro: Paresthesias, impaired cognitive function, seizures
Psychiatric: Depression
Musculoskeletal
Symptoms consistent with pseudohypoparathyroidism: Short metacarpals and short
stature
Symptoms consistent with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism: Hypothyroidism,
candidiasis, vitiligo, adrenal failure
Soft tissue calcifications
Neurological: Tetany, seizures, psychosis
Chvostek’s sign: Facial twitching after tapping the facial nerve
Trousseau’s sign: Carpopedal spasm after inflation of blood pressure cuff (over the
patient’s systolic blood pressure) for 2–3 minutes
Cardiovascular: Dysrhythmias, CHF, hypotension, prolonged QT
Ophthalmologic: Cataracts
Medications (listed above)
Past medical/surgical history: Previous neck surgery, history of diseases associated with
idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (hypothyroidism, adrenal failure) or Vitamin D deficiency
Family history of hypocalcemia: Familial hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, or
pseudohypoparathyroidism
LABORATORY
Ionized calcium and magnesium
Phosphorus: Usually elevated in hypocalcemia except in Vitamin D deficiency
BUN, creatinine, GFR
Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
Alkaline phosphatase
Albumin
MANAGEMENT
Severe acute hypocalcemia: Admission and IV calcium
Chronic hypocalcemia: Objective is to maintain serum calcium levels between 8–9mg/
dL. If hypercalciuria develops at serum calcium levels < 8.5mg/dL, Hydrochlorothiazide
50mg PO daily can be used to reduce urinary calcium excretion
PO: Calcium Carbonate (Tums, Os-Cal, Biocal, Caltrate) 500–1000mg PO TID (must
be spaced from other medications). Can use calcium citrate which does not affect
absorption of other drugs
Renal failure
Use phosphate binding antacids to reduce hyperphosphatemia (e.g., Amphojel)
222
LABS
Oral calcium supplementation 0.5–1.0g PO TID with meals. Tums provides
500mg elemental calcium and is the least expensive
For long term therapy, Vitamin D supplementation with Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) is
best choice for most patients due to its lower risk of toxicity. Initial dose is 0.25µg
PO daily. Most patients maintained with 0.5–2.0µg PO daily
Hypoparathyroidism or Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D and oral calcium
supplementation as noted above. Teriparatide or recombinant PTH was recently
approved for treatment of hypoparathyroidism as twice daily injections
Hypomagnesemia
Severe hypomagnesemia (with serum calcium < 0.8mg/dL): Treat as a medical
emergency in hospital setting
Chronic hypomagnesemia: Magnesium Oxide 400mg PO BID–4 ×/day
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients who take Digoxin and are hypocalcemic should be monitored on telemetry, as
hypocalcemia potentiates Digoxin toxicity
20% of patients with gram negative sepsis have hypocalcemia
Calcium is 2% of the normal body weight
