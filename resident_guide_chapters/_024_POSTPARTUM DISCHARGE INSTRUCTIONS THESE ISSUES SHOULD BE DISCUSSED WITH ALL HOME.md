24. POSTPARTUM DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
THESE ISSUES SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH ALL HOME-GOING
MOTHERS
No heavy lifting (anything heavier than the baby) or driving for 1–2 weeks. This needs
to be individualized as the reason not to drive is that episiotomy pain may cause hesitancy
while driving
No vaginal intercourse, tampons or douching for 6 weeks. This allows the vaginal
musculature to tighten and the episiotomy to heal
Sitz baths (sitting in a warm bath) may help episiotomy pain
Contraception
Ask all mothers what type of birth control they will be using. Breastfeeding alone is a
poor contraceptive. Depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) can be started
on postpartum day 1. They need to be informed that they may experience a longer
duration of postpartum bleeding with the progesterone
An estrogen-containing contraceptive may decrease milk production and contribute to
the normal hypercoagulable state of postpartum patients. An estrogen-containing oral
contraceptive may safely be started after 3–4 weeks. For undecided patients, encourage
using a condom with or without contraceptive foam until first postpartum visit
Pain medications: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Motrin) will usually be all
that is needed for vaginal deliveries
Call officeif temperature > 100.5°, increased abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, odorous
vaginal discharge, breast redness and pain, leg pain or shortness of breath
Prescribe a stool softener, docusate (Colace) 100mg PO BID. If prescribing narcotics
may want to prescribe a senna and Colace combination medication
Vaginal bleeding: Patients can expect some lochia for 3–4 weeks postpartum. Anything
heavier than a normal menstrual period should be evaluated
Breastfeeding: See Chapter 4, Infant Formula & Breastfeeding
Postpartum depression
Screen for postpartum depression while patient is in the hospital prior to discharge.
Also evaluate their support system at home
Patients should be reevaluated at the infant’s newborn visit and again at the mother’s
postpartum visit. There are many depression screening tools that can be downloaded
for free from the internet
Postpartum depression includes despondent mood, feelings of inadequacy as a parent,
sleep and appetite disturbances, with impaired concentration, and presents in 10–20%
of U.S. women within 6 months
Postpartum blues is a transient state of emotional reactivity (cry easily, irritability,
emotionally labile)—occurs in about 50% of women after birth and peaks at 3–5 days
after delivery
Antidepressants commonly prescribed include the serotonin selective reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs). Sertraline (Zoloft) is considered safe with breast feeding.
Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Citalopram (Celexa) have occasionally been associated with
sleep disturbance in nursing infants
Women with previous history of postpartum depression are at increased risk for
recurrence with subsequent pregnancies

25. POSTPARTUM CHECK-UP
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE
POSTPARTUM OFFICE VISIT
The postpartum visit is usually performed 6–8 weeks after delivery
HISTORY
Gravid and Parity
Type of delivery (Vaginal, Assisted, VBAC, C-section)
Number of weeks postpartum
Complications of labor and delivery (maternal and newborn)
Episiotomy or lacerations
Breast or bottle feeding
Fevers
Bowel/bladder problems, vaginal discharge
Symptoms of postpartum depression, screening with depression screening tool. Also
discussion of the possibility of developing depressive/dysthymic symptoms. These
symptoms may also be associated with thyroid dysfunction, which is commonly seen
in postpartum
Bonding with infant. How does the mother hold and interact with the infant? How
does the mother describe the infant? (happy, beautiful, or angry, mad)
Lochia/menses (date if has already occurred)
Resumption of intercourse (if yes, then type of contraception used). Type of birth
control desired
Assessment of support systems
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs including BP: If patient has gestational hypertension, it should be resolved
at this time and the blood pressure medications can be stopped
Thyroid-goiter and nodules are commonly found in the intrapartum and postpartum
period
Breast exam: Breast nodules and cancers are sometimes noted during the pregnancy
and postpartum period
Heart and lung exam
Perineum (episiotomy, laceration repair) and vaginal vault
Cervix (obtain Pap if abnormal during pregnancy, dysphasia may resolve after a
pregnancy)
Bimanual exam (assess uterine size and adnexa)
LABORATORY
H/H if anemic prior to labor or postpartum hemorrhage
Fasting blood glucose or A1c if gestational diabetes. Mothers with gestational diabetes
have a 30% increased chance of developing diabetes in their lifetime. If this is
transient, should be resolved at 8 weeks postpartum
TSH if indicated by symptoms or exam
