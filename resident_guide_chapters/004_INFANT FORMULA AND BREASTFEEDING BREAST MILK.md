4. INFANT FORMULA AND BREASTFEEDING
BREAST MILK: The gold standard of infant nutrition; mothers can nurse until at least 6
months without supplementing with solids
Goals: Healthy People 2020 has a goal of having 81.9% of all mothers initiate
breastfeeding, 60.6% continue breastfeeding at 6 months, and 34.1% breastfeeding at 1
year
Benefits of breastfeeding
There is no better nutrition for the baby than breast milk. The caloric and nutritional
content of the breast milk changes as the baby ages, providing the optimal nutrition for
the infant. The nutrients in breast milk are easier to assimilate than those in formula
because breast milk is easier to digest
Mothers who breastfeed reduce their risk of ovarian and breast cancer
Breastmilk production takes metabolic energy (~500kcal/day) and may help the
mother regain her pre-pregnancy weight. A higher caloric intake is required for
lactation
Breastfeeding is convenient and saves money
Enhanced maternal-infant bonding
Early breast milk (colostrum) provides antibodies to the infant, and may reduce the
infant’s incidence of illness in the first year of the life (including upper respiratory
infections, diarrheal illnesses and otitis media)
Exclusively breastfeeding the infant for at least 3 months reduces the risk of both Type
1 and Type 2 Diabetes
Breastfed infants are less likely to develop food allergies because the breast-milk
antibodies prevent the absorption of allergy-provoking proteins
Breastfeeding promotes growth of optimal gut microbiome, as well as proper immune
responses to antigens long-term. Breastfeeding is also associated with decreased risk
of developing inflammatory bowel disease in the infant
Breastfed infants have lower lifetime risk of obesity
Colostrum has a laxative effect assisting with the early evacuation of meconium
Exclusive breastfeeding may be an effective birth control method for several months
after delivery, through delay of restarting menstruation. This should NOT be relied
upon solely as a reliable form of birth control
Common breastfeeding problems
Breast engorgement
Often occurs for the first time when the milk comes in, usually the second or third
postpartum day. Can occur at any time when the mother has not breast-fed or
pumped her breasts
To decrease engorgement, the mother should pump or express her breasts to
release some of the excess milk build-up. Warm compresses or a hot shower can
help the milk let-down. Frequent nursing during this stage is important
Mastitis
Initially women may experience flu-like symptoms with myalgias, fevers, and
chills. One of the breasts then becomes erythematous, tender, and edematous in a
particular area
Management
Frequent breastfeedings (with both breasts being utilized), rest, plenty of
fluids, acetaminophen
Warm compresses to the affected breast for pain relief
Antibiotics: Duration of treatment is 10–14 days. Most common organisms

are Staph aureus (MSSA or MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia
coli. If MRSA is not a concern Dicloxacillin 500mg PO 4 ×/day or Cephalexin
500mg PO 4 x/day. If MRSA is possible Clindamycin 300mg PO 4 ×/day or
TMP-SMX-DS 1–2 tabs PO BID
Bilateral mastitis: Rare and may be a sign of a Group B Streptococcal infection
which has been transmitted to the mother from the infant. (This is a serious
infection and would require immediate treatment of the infant and the mother)
Yeast infections: If the infant develops thrush, it may transmit the infection to the
mother and she may develop “thrush nipples”
Symptoms include erythematous, edematous, cracked, painful nipples. Both the
infant and the mother need to be treated
The infant is given Nystatin Oral Suspension (100,000 U/mL) 1mL PO 4 ×/day for
2 weeks. Administer after nursing
The mother should apply an antifungal ointment (miconazole) after nursing (See
Chapter 101, Warts, Scabies, Lice & Superficial Tinea Infection Management)
Breast abscess
Rare complication of mastitis
Treatment: Incision and drainage
Cracked or bleeding nipples
Can occur at any time during the nursing process. Prevention is important
Infant needs to be properly positioned on the breast, lactation consult is beneficial
Daily shower or bath with warm water is sufficient to keep the breasts clean. Soaps
and detergents should not be used on the breasts since they are drying to the skin.
Breast creams are unnecessary and may contribute to sore nipples
Breast milk that is left on the breast after nursing may be gently rubbed on the
nipples
Plastic-lined breast pads and wet breast shields should be avoided
The mother should invest in several good cotton nursing bras that provide support
but are not constricting. Bras that are too tight or have underwire may lead to
blocked ducts
Galactocele: Blocked lactiferous duct
Round, well circumscribed, easily mobile cystic mass
Treatment: Initially warm compresses and frequent feedings or pumping to open
and drain blocked duct. May require needle aspiration. Thick milky secretion
confirms diagnosis
Nursing frequency
Initially the infant should breastfeed frequently, usually 8–15 feedings in a 24-hour
period
The infant can be kept on the first breast until interest in feeding is lost (usually 10–20
minutes). Then remove from that breast, burp, and place on the second breast. Infant
may not feed as long on the second breast; therefore, the mother should start with the
alternate breast at the subsequent feeding
Breastfeeding works on a supply-and-demand basis. The more an infant feeds, the
more milk the breasts will produce. It is important that the infant nurse frequently and
for as long as desired, so that an adequate milk supply will be produced
Supplementation is not necessary and may hinder the establishment of a good breast-
feeding relationship
Vitamin supplementation
Vitamin D
All infants and children, including adolescents, should have a minimum daily
intake of 400IU of Vitamin D. Deficiency/insufficiencyand rickets have increased
due to decreased sunlight exposure (sunscreen, lifestyle changes, dress habits)
Breastfed and partially breastfed infants should be supplemented with 400IU/day
of Vitamin D beginning in the first few days of life, until the infant is receiving at
least 1L/day of Vitamin D-fortified formula
Most multivitamin liquid preparations contain Vitamin D 400IU/1mL

Iron
There is debate surrounding iron supplementation
The term newborn has an estimated 4–6 month store of iron accumulated during
gestation. At 6 months of age the physician needs to decide if the infant needs iron
supplementation or if the infant is eating enough iron-fortified cereal to meet iron
needs
Consider strongly supplementing the preterm infant, especially if breastfeeding
Fluoride (F): No supplementation recommended if
Child is breastfeeding —OR—
Child’s home receives commercially fluoridated water, or the family’s well water
has > 0.6ppm F
If a child receives water from a nonfluoridated source or a well with < 0.6ppm F,
supplementation should begin with the following dosage guidelines
Water containing < 0.3ppm F: 0–6 months of age: None. 6 months–3 years of age:
0.25 mg/day. 3–6 years of age: 0.50 mg/day. 6–16 years of age: 1.0 mg/day
Water containing 0.3–0.6ppm F: 0–3 years of age: None. 3–6 years of age: 0.25
mg/day. 6–16 years of age: 0.50 mg/day
Medications and lactation: See Chapter 22, Medications During Pregnancy & Lactation

occult GI bleeding and subsequent anemia
Infants should not receive honey in any form until > 1 year of age due to risk of botulism
