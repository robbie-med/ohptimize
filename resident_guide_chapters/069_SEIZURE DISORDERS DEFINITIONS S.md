69. SEIZURE DISORDERS
DEFINITIONS
Seizure: A brief, sudden, excessive discharge of electrical activity in the brain that alters
behavior
Epilepsy: Recurrent seizures without clear precipitating factors (such as alcohol
withdrawal, hypoglycemia)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
1 in 11 will have at least 1 seizure
In U.S. 1.5 million with active epilepsy
7 million with epilepsy at some time
Peaks in infancy and again later in life
SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION
Reactive: Abnormal reaction of an otherwise normal brain (febrile, hypoglycemia)
Symptomatic: Secondary to underlying structural or biochemical abnormality
Idiopathic: No known cause, except for possibly genetic
PRINCIPAL TYPES OF SEIZURES*
Generalized
Absence seizures (petit mal)
Seizure starts rapidly, averaging 10 seconds of unresponsiveness with rapid
recovery
Hyperventilation may precipitate seizure
Muscle tone may be increased or decreased, with automatisms or mild clonic
movement
First seizure between ages of 3–20 years
Primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal)
Loss of consciousness without warning or preceded by myoclonic jerks
Clinical features similar to those of a secondarily generalized partial seizure
Partial
Simple partial seizures (focal)
Signs and symptoms may be motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic, depending on
the electrical discharge location
Consciousness not impaired
Complex partial seizures (temporal lobe or psychomotor)
May begin without warning or with motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic signs or
symptoms
Consciousness impaired
Automatisms may occur
Period of confusion often follows seizure
Secondarily generalized partial seizures (tonic-clonic, or grand mal)
May begin with motor, sensory, autonomic or psychic signs or symptoms
Loss of consciousness, with tonic increase in muscle tone
Subsequent rhythmic (clonic) jerks subside slowly
Patient comatose after seizure with slow recovery
Tongue biting and/or incontinence may occur

ETIOLOGY
Infection: Meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial abscess
Trauma: Concussion, subdural/epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage
Intoxication: Amphetamine, cocaine, PCP, Propoxyphene, tricyclics, phenothiazines,
Wellbutrin, Theophylline, alcohol (withdrawal), Aspirin, Romazicon, organophosphates,
carbon monoxide, Lithium
Metabolic: Hyper/hypoglycemia, hyper/hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia,
kernicterus, hypoxia, uremia, inborn errors of metabolism, pyridoxine deficiency
Degenerative: Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Tay-Sachs, leukodystrophies
Congenital: Abnormal brain development, cerebral palsy, neuronal migrational defects,
tuberous sclerosis, etc.
Neoplasms: Primary or metastatic
Vascular: Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, global
cerebral hypoperfusion
Idiopathic: Mesial temporal sclerosis, genetic, etc.
Febrile seizures: See VII. A. below
EVALUATION
History: Provoking factors, medications, premonitory symptoms, eyewitness accounts.
Focal features, tongue biting/blood in the mouth, incontinence, postictal state
Physical exam: Complete neurologic exam, skin lesions (rash, neurocutaneous stigmata),
fever, infection in ears or sinuses, trauma, congenital anomalies
Laboratory (as indicated for initial seizure)
CBC/blood cultures (for febrile patients), glucose, electrolytes (including calcium/
magnesium)
Drug tests (look for intoxications, antiepileptic levels, EtOH)
Lumbar puncture (in selected patients)
Neuroimaging
CT head: For emergent evaluation/new onset seizures (trauma, vascular)
MR head: Provides more detail, for more in depth evaluation of etiology
PET/SPECT scans: Primarily for presurgical evaluation
Electrodiagnostics
Routine EEG (yield for single EEG approximately 50% in patients with epilepsy)
Sleep deprived EEG (more sensitive, combined with routine EEG, 80% sensitive)
EEG monitoring (for refractory epilepsy or evaluation of pseudoseizures)
Differential diagnosis: Panic attacks, syncope, breath holding spell, pseudoseizures,
sleep disorders (narcolepsy), migraine, TIA, episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks),
Meniere’s disease, movement disorders
MANAGEMENT
Indications for medications
Two or more unprovoked seizures
Single seizure with risk factors (abnormal EEG, certain neuroimaging abnormalities,
certain hereditary epilepsies including family history of seizures)
Usual starting medications (See Table below for dosing)
Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
Divalproex Sodium (Depakote)
Phenytoin (Dilantin)
Absence
Ethosuximide (Zarontin)
Divalproex Sodium (Depakote)
Partial seizures
Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
Divalproex Sodium (Depakote)
Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)
Phenytoin (Dilantin)
317
GEN
Pregabalin (Lyrica)
Topiramate (Topamax)
Levetiracetam (Keppra)
Common side-effects with all medications are sedation, dizziness, ataxia, headache,
nausea, and rash
Usual doses of antiepileptic drugs in patients ≥age 16
Women’s issues
Many seizure medications can increase failure rate for oral contraceptives (consider
additional barrier method)
Many seizure medications increase the risk of birth defects (especially Valproic Acid
and Carbamazepine which increase risk of neural tube defects)
Many seizure medications increase risk for bone loss. Increased use of bone density
scanning and calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended
Discontinuing therapy
Continue medications for 2 years after starting (even if patient is seizure free during
this time)
Risk of recurrent seizures is 25% for patients without risk factors, 50% for patients
with risk factors
Surgery
Refractory seizures with identifiable seizure focus—may benefit from surgical
resection (especially mesial temporal epilepsy)
Vagal nerve stimulator—refractory patients
Driving: Laws vary state to state, but most range from 3–12 months seizure free—it
is usually the physician’s responsibility to report patient to BMV or inform patient of
obligations
Febrile seizures
The most common seizure of childhood
Diagnosis: Tonic-clonic movements associated with temperature > 100.4o F (38.0o C)
Usually occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age
Duration of seizure activity < 15 minutes
Seizure activity within 24 hours of onset of fever
Normal development and neurologic exam
No family history of epilepsy
Diagnosis of febrile seizure is a diagnosis of exclusion
Appropriate laboratory tests, including lumbar puncture, should be considered in any
child with a seizure, especially if < 18 months-old
If child with febrile seizure meets all of the criteria listed above and child appears fine,
an antipyretic may be given and no further studies or treatment are necessary. Risk of
recurrence is 25–30% with simple febrile seizures
CLINICAL PEARLS
Epilepsy peaks in childhood (75% begin in childhood) and again in later adulthood
Most common reason for seizure recurrence (and status epilepticus) is medication
noncompliance
After medications are discontinued, 80% of recurrences will occur during first 4 months
and 90% within first year
Recurrence rate for a single, unprovoked seizure is 30 to 70% (higher for abnormal tests or
exam)
In 50% of children with seizures, the etiology will be undetermined despite an appropriate
work-up

GEN
Breath-holding spells, benign paroxysmal vertigo, and syncope are often confused with
seizures and should be considered in differential diagnosis
