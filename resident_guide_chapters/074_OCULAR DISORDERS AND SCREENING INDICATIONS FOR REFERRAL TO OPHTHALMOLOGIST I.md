74. OCULAR DISORDERS AND SCREENING
INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL TO OPHTHALMOLOGIST
Immediate referral
Penetrating trauma: History of missile type injury, high velocity, metal on metal,
irregular pupil
Acute glaucoma: Red and painful eye, pupil semi-dilated and fixed, hazy cornea
decreased vision. May have nausea and abdominal pain
Corneal ulcer: Red and painful eye, photophobia, fluorescein staining on cornea.
Usually associated with trauma, poor lid apposition, or contact lens wear
Postoperative infection/endophthalmitis: Pain, decreased vision, white cell level in
anterior chamber, purulent drainage. Can result from any invasive ophthalmologic
procedure
Iritis: Limbal flush, photophobia, small pupil, sore eye. Usually post-traumatic
Floaters or flashes: Differential includes retinal detachment or hole, posterior vitreous
detachment
Sudden decreased vision: Occlusion of the retinal vein or artery, trauma, or stroke
Orbital cellulitis: Fever, pain or restriction of eye movements, endophthalmitis,
periorbital swelling
Chemical exposure with alkali
Referral within several days: Poor healing of corneal abrasion, unresponsive
conjunctivitis, double vision or any visual problem that does not improve with treatment
HISTORY
Onset and duration of symptoms (sudden, gradual), and associated symptoms including
pain, redness, itching, burning, crusting/matting
Change in vision: Floaters, halos, scotoma (zigzags), photopsia (flashing lights), specific
visual field defects
Photophobia
Pain, with or without eye movement
Diplopia (double vision)
Systemic symptoms of CVA/TIA, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (from the severe
pain), fever, temporal pain
Contact lens wear
Night blindness or vision decrease (combined with myopia, cataracts, retinitis
pigmentosa)
Recent eye surgery or trauma (if so, was the patient wearing safety glasses)
PHYSICAL EXAM
Check visual acuity of each eye with correction. If corrective lenses not available, use
pinhole (patient reads visual acuity chart through a pinhole which should compensate for
any uncorrected refractive errors)
Check pupils
Size: Anisocoria (unequal pupils) may be acute or chronic (secondary to old trauma,
surgery or a normal variant)
Reactivity: Sluggish versus rapidly reactive
Swinging flashlight test: Checks consensual response in opposite pupil (evaluation for
optic nerve damage, i.e., glaucoma, retrobulbar neuritis)
336
GEN
Inspect lids for lid eversion (ectropion), lid inversion (entropion), lash growth toward
the cornea (trichiasis), chalazion (See below). Also check for lash loss (hypothyroid) or
crusting. May need to evert lid to check for foreign body, signs of blepharitis
Extraocular muscle function: Motility and position
Cranial nerve III: Innervates medial, inferior, and superior rectus and inferior oblique
as well as levator muscle of lid
Cranial nerve IV: Innervates superior oblique
Cranial nerve VI: Innervates lateral rectus
Strabismus: Misalignment of the eyes
Fluorescein staining: Will stain areas of denuded or damaged epithelium (corneal
abrasion, ulceration, etc.)
Tonometry: Average intra-ocular pressure is < 21mmHg
Funduscopic exam
Dilation: Eyes may be dilated if anterior chamber is not shallow (observed by shining
light beam across the anterior chamber). Dilate with Neo-Synephrine 2.5% or 1%
Mydriacyl (avoid Atropine due to long duration of action). Dilation causing an attack
of acute angle closure glaucoma is extremely uncommon
Exam
Red reflex: If unequal, consider cataract, vitreous hemorrhage, tumor
Hemorrhages (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, trauma or renal disease)
Retinal detachment
Cotton wool spots: Infarctions of nerve fibers
Cherry red spot in macula: Central retinal artery occlusion
Papilledema, A-V nicking, cup/disc ratio (average is 0.3)
Confrontation visual field: To detect peripheral vision defects
Slit lamp exam: To examine anterior segment of eye, remove foreign bodies, and check
for inflammatory cells in anterior chamber
Hyphema: Blood in anterior chamber
Hypopyon: Layered white cells in anterior chamber (Seen in iritis or infection)
Flare: Light scatter caused by inflammatory cells or proteins in the aqueous fluid
MANAGEMENT
Conjunctivitis
Bacterial: Purulent drainage, red eye, minimal pain, no change in vision. Use 1 drop
to affected eye every 2 hours while awake × 2 days, then 4 ×/day × 3–5 days. Many
choices including
Aminoglycosides such as Tobramycin or Bacitracin
Quinolone such as Ofloxacin (Ocuflox) or Ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan) for more severe
infections
Neosporin containing drops (Neomycin, Polymyxin B, and Gramicidin) may cause
allergic reactions
Encourage hand washing
Viral: No treatment necessary except infection control
Allergic: Itchy, red eyes. Bilateral. Many choices, including
Antihistamine/decongestant: Vasocon-A
Mast cell stabilizer: Crolom Solution 4%, (Cromolyn Sodium) 1gtt 4 ×/day,
Bepotastine 1.5% (Bepreve) 1gtt BID, Alomide (Lodoxamide 0.1%) 1–2gtts 4 ×/
day, Alocril (Nedocromil 2%) 1–2gtts BID
Histamine antagonist: Levocabastine (Livostin 0.05%) 1 gtt 4 ×/day
Antihistamine/Mast-cell stabilizer: Emedastine (Emadine) 1–2gtts BID
Antihistamine/Mast-cell stabilizer/Eosinophil inhibitor: Zaditor (Ketotifen
0.025%) 1gtt every 8–12 hours
NSAID: Ketorolac 0.5 (Acular), 1gtt 4 ×/day
Steroid eye drops, not for extended use
Systemic antihistamines: See Chapter 75, Allergic Rhinitis/Seasonal Allergies
337
GEN
Corneal abrasion: History of mild trauma (e.g., fingernail scratch, tree branch, contact
lens), photophobia, conjunctival injection, involuntary lid closure, increased tearing,
decreased vision if abrasion is located at center of cornea. Distinguish from corneal foreign
body, herpes simplex (dendritic appearance to corneal stain), or corneal ulcer (infiltrate
around corneal defect)
Use slit lamp to facilitate exam. If no slit lamp available, magnification of
ophthalmoscope may be used for direct observation or by localizing the abrasion or
foreign body against red reflex
Topical anesthetic (to relieve discomfort and facilitate examination): 1 drop of
Tetracaine 0.5% or Proparacaine (Alcaine 0.5%) will lead to immediate relief of pain.
Do not send anesthetic drops home with patient
Prophylactic eye drops (antibiotics) may be prescribed. If severe discomfort, may also
give Cycloplegic such as Cyclogyl 1% (Cyclopentolate) or Homatropine 2% or 5%
TID) which will make patient more comfortable
Patient should follow-up in 1–2 days if not healed
Corneal foreign body
Topical anesthetic as used in corneal abrasion (See IV. B. above)
Remove corneal foreign body with blunt instrument, cotton swab, or forceps
Patient may return to normal activities immediately. No need to patch eye
If a rust ring remains or foreign body cannot be removed, then refer
Conjunctival foreign body
No anesthetic necessary
Evert upper eyelid and remove foreign body with cotton swab
May see linear, vertical corneal abrasions (ice-skate track abrasions) indicating
retained foreign bodies in the superior tarsal conjunctiva
Blepharitis: History of burning, excessive tearing (epiphora), foreign body sensation with
erythema of lid margin, dandruff-like deposits on lashes, fibrinous scales around individual
lashes (collarettes), lash loss, recurrent mild conjunctivitis. Caused by seborrhea, staph
infection, and/or meibomian gland dysfunction and frequently recurs
Antibacterial eye drops, treat 7–10 days (chronic cases may require intermittent
antibiotic and/or steroid drops)
Wash lids every day with baby shampoo (eyes closed)
Warm compresses to eye TID
Wash hands after touching eyes
Sudden onset double vision: Distinguish monocular from binocular double vision;
binocular will resolve when either eye is covered. Monocular is secondary to uncorrected
refractive error, dry eye, corneal scar, or cataract. Binocular diplopia may be secondary
to nerve palsies (III, IV, or VI), decompensated strabismus, diabetes, cerebral aneurysm,
tumor, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, orbital blow-out fractures
Patch either eye for symptomatic relief while awaiting definitive diagnosis
Evaluate for above mentioned entities and refer to ophthalmologist
Chalazion: Firm well-demarcated nodule just below lid margin; may have grayish
discoloration on conjunctival surface which is secondary to a lipogranulomatous
inflammation of meibomian gland
May be symptom-free, or nodule may be tender and erythematous
Treatment includes frequent warm compresses and ATB drops initially. After 1 month
ophthalmologist may inject, lance, or excise the chalazion
Stye (hordeolum): Painful, erythematous, often pointed nodule on surface of skin
(external stye) or on conjunctival surface (internal stye) which is usually caused by a staph
infection of a sebaceous gland of the lid. Treatment includes warm compresses and topical
ATB drops
Open-angle glaucoma
Refers to a group of diseases with progressive optic nerve damage and visual field
loss, usually with associated elevations in intraocular pressure. Prevalence 0.5% of the
population. Increased incidence with positive family history
Average intraocular pressure is < 21mmHg
338
GEN
Damage from glaucoma is manifested by optic nerve “cupping” (caused by loss of
neurons and glial tissue). Cup-to-disc ratio of ≥0.6 or greater is one sign of glaucoma
Visual field loss over time (usually spares the central visual field until late)
Angle-closure glaucoma: Women > men, may have acute severe eye pain and blurry
vision, with associated nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain. May see halos
around lights. Requires immediate medical therapy followed by laser iridectomy
PRIMARY/PREVENTIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY SCHEDULE
Neonates
Ophthalmologic screen for retinopathy of prematurity if birth weight < 1500g, < 33
weeks gestation, or received O2 therapy for > 48 hours at birth
In all other neonates, red reflexes should be checked at birth and every visit thereafter
to screen for congenital cataracts, retinoblastoma, congenital glaucoma. Cataracts
should be treated before the age of 3 months to prevent amblyopia. In more darkly
pigmented individuals, the red reflex may look dull orange or whitish orange—make
sure this is symmetric and uniform across entire reflex
Preschool
Screen for strabismus (exotropia and esotropia) with cover-uncover test and pupillary
light reflex test (normally both light reflexes should be centered in each pupil). Begin
screening at birth—prior to 4 months of age, infants may show variable crossing
or drifting out of the eyes due to underdevelopment of the macula. If strabismus is
not picked up early, it may lead to amblyopia (decreased vision in 1 eye). Refer for
ophthalmologic evaluation
Vision screening is feasible at around age 3½ years; will initially use the Allen test
(pictures) until child is able to read numbers or letters
School-aged children: Should have vision screen at least every 2–3 years if asymptomatic
Adults
Routine “glaucoma” exam (Funduscopic exam and IOP) at 35 then every 2 years
(yearly if family history of glaucoma)
Funduscopic exam at least yearly in patients at increased risk—diabetes mellitus,
family history of retinal detachments, or glaucoma corticosteroid therapy, Plaquenil,
Mellaril, Ethambutol (visual acuity)
Age > 65; full eye exam every 1–2 years regardless of risk factors
Diabetes: Examine type 1 diabetics within 3–5 years of diagnosis and type 2 diabetics
shortly after diagnosis. Subsequent exams annually
SPECIFIC PEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGIC DISORDERS
Conjunctivitis
In neonates, may be toxic conjunctivitis from routine perinatal prophylaxis
Infectious conjunctivitis may be caused by staph, chlamydia, herpes virus, gonorrhea.
If discharge is purulent and excessive, gonorrhea is probable; blindness can result in
24–48 hours, should be immediately referred
Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (congenital)
Obstruction is common. It is usually unilateral which is often congenital due to lack of
patency of the inferior ostium of the nasolacrimal duct. The tear lake is elevated, and
the eye appears weepy
At risk for bacterial superinfection: Eyelids will be adherent with purulent matter on
awakening. Lids are red with tearing of the eye. Infections may recur in spite of topical
antibiotics, unless duct opens or is opened up with massage and/or probing
Approximately 75% spontaneously open within first 6 months of life. Should be
referred for duct probing after 6 months if no resolution. If persistent purulent
drainage, then refer earlier
Can put pressure on nasolacrimal sac with a cotton swab or finger; if expression of
mucopurulent material is seen from the puncta, then nasolacrimal duct obstruction is
the diagnosis
Parent should massage over the duct 3–4 ×/day; this will relieve most obstructions
339
GEN
Strabismus (See V. Primary/Preventive schedule, above)
Inward, outward, or upward deviation of 1 or both eyes; pupils are misaligned
Any patient with constant deviation, or deviation that develops after the first 3–4
months of life, should be referred to ophthalmologist
Therapy usually involves patching of good eye and/or corrective lenses (after
evaluation to rule-out tumor, cataract, etc.)
Ideally, eyes should be straightened before age 2 to increase chance of stereopsis
(normal depth perception)
CLINICAL PEARLS
Vertically oriented, linear corneal abrasions may indicate a conjunctival foreign body
under the upper lid. Evert the upper lid with a cotton swab
Never send anesthetic eye drops home with patients with corneal abrasions; they delay
healing by preventing re-epithelialization of the cornea, and may damage the cornea,
resulting in blindness
Always check vision before examination and treatment
Be alert for herpes simplex; dendritic appearance under fluorescein staining
Neomycin can cause allergic reaction in up to 10% of patients
