8. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP) IN
INFANTS AND CHILDREN
SIGNIFICANCE
Every year there are more than 150 million cases of pneumonia in children worldwide and
over 2 million of those children die from pneumonia
In the developed world, there are 3–4 cases of pneumonia per 100 children < 5 years-old
DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP)
An acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma associated with both of the following
Symptoms of acute infection (See History section below)
Presence of an acute infiltrate on chest x-ray or auscultatory findings consistent with
pneumonia (See Physical exam section below)
Pneumonia is considered nosocomial (not community-acquired) if the patient has been
hospitalized 14 days prior to presentation
ETIOLOGY—Note: A definitive pathogen is found only in about ⅓of patients
Neonate
Group B Streptococcus
Listeria monocytogenes
Gram negatives—E.Coli, Klebsiella
Chlamydia Trachomatis (neonate to 3 months of age)
CMV, HSV, Rubella
< 1 year-old
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenza
Staphylococcus aureus
RSV, Parainfluenza virus
> 1 year-old
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Staphylococcus aureus
Influenza virus
Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza,Adenovirus
Chlamydia Pneumoniae, Mycoplasma (school-age)
Immunocompromised patient: Any of the above, in addition
Fungal organisms: Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcus
Pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium spp., CMV
DIAGNOSIS
History
Symptoms
General: Rigors, chills, fever, lethargy, poor feeding
Lungs: Cough, sputum production (may or may not be present), dyspnea
Chest: Pleuritic chest pain
Musculoskeletal: Myalgias and arthralgias
Timing and preceding symptoms: Sudden onset (indicative of “classic” pneumococ-
cal pneumoniae), recent influenza infection
25
PEDS
Risk Factors: Extremes of age, smoking, alcohol or IV drug use, immunocompromised
state, nursing or group home resident, child in daycare, history of influenza-like
illness, risk factors for aspiration (syncope, loss of consciousness, cerebral palsy,
sedative drugs)
Physical exam
Vitals: Fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia
State of hydration: Skin turgor, mucous membranes, urine output
Lung exam
Inspection: Retractions, use of accessory muscles
Auscultation: Crackles, rhonchi, wheezing, whispered pectoriloquy, egophony (“E
to A changes”)
X-ray
Should be used to confirm or evaluate for diagnosis unless classic physical exam
symptoms are present
Complications of pneumonia seen on CXR can include
Parapneumonic effusions
Necrotizing pneumonia
Pneumothorax
Laboratory
Oxygenation
Pulse oximetry should be used in ALL patients with pneumonia or suspected
hypoxemia
Arterial blood gas: Not generally helpful in outpatient setting
Labs
Sputum gram stain and culture: Not necessary in outpatient CAP
Blood cultures: Per 2011 ISDA “should not be routinely performed in nontoxic,
fully immunized children with CAP managed in the outpatient setting.” They may
be helpful in treatment failure
CBC: Generally unhelpful; leukocyte count should not be used in decision-making
unless for severe pneumonia
Urine antigens: Not recommended. High number of false positives
Viral testing: A positive influenza test or RSV test decreases possibility of bacterial
etiology
ADMISSION INDICATIONS
Respiratory distress (note: the findings below may be seen with respiratory distress,
tachypnea is the most sensitive finding)
Tachypnea (defined by age)
Age 0–2 months > 60 breaths/minute
Age 2–12 months > 50 breaths/minute
Age 1–5 years > 40 breaths/minute
Age < 5 years > 20 breaths/minute
Dyspnea
Retractions
Grunting
Nasal flaring
Altered level of consciousness
Oxygen saturation ≤90%
Infants < 6 months of age
Pathogen with increased virulence—e.g., MRSA
Concern about compliance or inability to ensure good care at home
Toxic appearing or with underlying medical conditions that predispose to complications
such as BPD or congenital heart defects

MANAGEMENT
Antibiotic therapy should be based on the patient’s age and severity of illness, and local
resistance patterns of pathogens
Antibiotic therapy is not routinely required for preschool-aged children with CAP as
viral pathogens are responsible for the great majority of clinical disease (per 2011 IDSA
Guidelines)
Amoxicillin
First-line for mild-to-moderate CAP
Provides appropriate coverage for Streptococcus pneumonia
Dose: 90mg/kg/day divided BID (if PCN allergic use Cephalosporin or Macrolide)
Alternatives: 2nd or 3rd generation Cephalosporins
Cefpodoxime (Vantin): 10mg/kg/day divided BID (max 400mg/day)
Cefuroxime (Ceftin): 30mg/kg/day divided BID (max 1g/day)
Cefprozil (Cefzil): 30mg/kg/day divided BID (max 1g/day)
Cefdinir (Omnicef): 14mg/kg/day divided BID (max 600mg/day)
Ceftriaxone (Rocephin): IM—50mg/kg × 1
Macrolide therapy (use if concerned for atypical bacterial etiologies)
Azithromycin (Zithromax): 10mg/kg on day 1 and then 5mg/kg for 4 additional
days. Available: 200mg/5mL and 100mg/5mL
Clarithromycin (Biaxin): 15mg/kg/day divided BID for 7–10 days. Available
250mg/ 5mL
Duration of therapy: Usually 7–10 days
Antiviral therapy for influenza
Use as early as possible during outbreaks. Do not need to wait for confirmation.
Influenza testing may have false negative results. Should be started within 48 hours of
illness but may be helpful after 48 hours with severe pneumonia
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
Dosing < 1 year—3mg/kg PO BID × 5 days—Available 6mg/mL, pills 30, 45,
75mg
Dosing > 1 year (< 15kg)—30mg PO BID × 5 days or 1½ tsp PO BID
Dosing > 1 year (15–23kg)—45mg PO BID × 5 days or 2 tsp PO BID
Dosing > 1 year (23–40kg)—60mg PO BID × 5 days or 2½ tsp PO BID
Dosing > 1 year (> 40kg)—75mg PO BID × 5 days
FOLLOW-UP
Patients should demonstrate clinical improvement within 2–3 days, re-evaluate in the
office by that time
Return with continued high fever, worsening dyspnea, inability to swallow medications
or keep down liquids, failure to improve after 2 days of antibiotics, chest pain, or
hemoptysis
Follow-up CXR is not necessary since initial x-ray findings may take weeks/months to
clear
PREVENTION
Pneumococcal 13-valent vaccine in pediatric population is effective in decreasing
pediatric pneumococcal pneumonia in ages 6 weeks–71 months
Influenza vaccine: Indicated yearly for all patients 6 months and older, particularly those
at risk for pneumonia, under 2 years of age and older than 65
Due to the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia following pertussis infection,
and the waning of pertussis immunity over time, it is recommended to replace tetanus
boosters with Tdap boosters in all populations
All infants should complete HIB vaccination series
High risk infants should be provided RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies

CLINICAL PEARLS
To minimize resistance to antibiotics use the proper dose of an antibiotic focused to the
probable organism for the shortest duration possible
Pneumococcus remains the most common identified cause of bacterial pneumonia in
children and adults
Consider HIV in cases of recurrent pneumonia; check the mouth for thrush, OHL—See
Chapter 44, Ambulatory HIV/AIDS Management
Viral disease accounts for approximately 80% of CAP in children < 2 years of age
