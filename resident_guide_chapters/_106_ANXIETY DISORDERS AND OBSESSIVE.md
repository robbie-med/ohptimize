106. ANXIETY DISORDERS AND OBSESSIVE-
COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS
INTRODUCTION
DSM-V assigned anxiety and OCD to separate categories
Anxiety disorders
Separation anxiety disorders, selective mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
substance or medication induced anxiety disorder
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder,
trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, substance or medication induced obsessive
compulsive disorder
Panic disorder is the most common of the anxiety disorders in which patients will
seek treatment and can be very disabling with severe financial, social, and occupational
consequences for the patient
Patients with panic disorder often have many physical complaints. Delineate between
symptoms resulting from the panic disorder and those which are non-psychiatric in origin
Rule out organic causes for the patient’s symptoms of anxiety
MEDICAL CAUSES OF ANXIETY
Before diagnosing an anxiety disorder, a complete history and physical exam and lab work (if
indicated) will be necessary to rule out other organic causes. New onset anxiety in an older
patient should be a red flag to evaluate for other causes
Endocrine: Hyperthyroid, hypoglycemia, carcinoid syndrome, parathyroid dysfunction,
pheochromocytoma, adrenal dysfunction, and hypothyroid
Inflammatory: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
polyarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis
Neurologic: CNS tumors, migraine, subarachnoid hemorrhage, syphilis, multiple sclerosis,
Wilson’s disease, Huntington’s chorea, seizure disorders, TLE encephalitis
Cardiopulmonary: Angina, pulmonary insufficiency, CHF, pulmonary embolism, COPD,
asthma, arrhythmia
Nutritional: Pellagra, Vitamin B12 deficiency
Metabolic: Porphyria
Pharmacologic: Alcohol and drug abuse or withdrawal, amphetamines, caffeine,
sympathomimetics, tobacco
Assess for other psychiatric disorders such as depression
PANDAS in children: Autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Group A
streptococcal infections
GUIDELINES FOR TREATMENT OF ALL ANXIETY DISORDERS
Consideration should be given to non-pharmacologic approaches (cognitive-behavior
therapy is indicated regardless of pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic approaches). Limit
caffeine
Define underlying conflicts and stresses, coping mechanisms and support systems
Consider if psychosocial factors or the patient’s personality place the patient at risk for
abuse or addiction
474
PSYCH
Individualize anxiolytic therapy. SSRIs are first line treatment. Benzodiazepines should
be prescribed for only short periods (2–5 weeks) to avoid tolerance and rebound anxiety/
rebound insomnia
Goals and expectations of treatment should be clearly discussed with the patient
In the elderly
Start with half dose regimen
Avoid frequent dosing adjustments
Watch for signs of confusion, sedation, ataxia
— PART ONE: GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD) —
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Prevalence is 2.9% of the general population; female-to-male ratio is 2:1
Age of onset is in the 20s, although there is a clear rise in diagnosis of children and
adolescents
15–17% of first-degree relatives have GAD
Over half onset in childhood or adolescence. Course is chronic waxing/waning

PSYCH
Medications (Sympathomimetics, Yohimbine, Desipramine)
Anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition
TREATMENT
Remove exacerbating factors: Caffeine, tobacco, drugs, alcohol
Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy or group psychotherapy may help in
treating a generalized anxiety disorder
Exercise: Aerobic exercise is 20 minutes of uninterrupted exercise with heart rate > 120,
performed a minimum of 3× a week. Smart phone apps are available for these even with
no previous experience with regular exercise to help them start safely and encourage them
Medications: SSRIs and SNRIs are generally first-line
Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Drug of first choice for anxiety. May
also be used for social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic
disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). May take several weeks to start
working. Start at half dose for 3–5 days, then increase to usual daily dosage. Avoid abrupt
withdrawal
Efficacious without addictive properties. Consider starting at ½ the antidepressant dose
to avoid initially exacerbating anxiety
May use BDZ initially when starting SSRIs as the SSRI may not decrease symptoms
for the first several weeks
Escitalopram (Lexapro 10–20mg/day), Sertraline (Zoloft 50–150mg/day, max 200mg/
day), Citalopram (Celexa 10–40mg/day), Paroxetine (Paxil 10–50mg/day), Fluoxetine
(Prozac 10–60mg/day)
Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
Duloxetine (Cymbalta): Starting dose 30–60mg once daily, max dose 60–120mg/once
daily
Venlafaxine (Effexor): Starting dose 37.5–75mg once daily, max dose 225mg/day
Mirtazapine (Remeron): 15–45mg PO at bedtime
Side-effects in this class include nausea, anorexia, diaphoresis, headache, insomnia
Other medication options
Buspirone (BuSpar) 5mg PO BID–TID (gradually increase to 30–60mg/day). Does
not have the sedative, withdrawal, or abuse potential seen with the Benzodiazepines.
Effects of the drug may take several weeks to become evident. Side-effects: Dizziness,
drowsiness, headache
Hydroxyzine Pamoate (Vistaril)—an antihistamine: 50mg/day (in divided doses) up to
50mg PO TID. May be useful during titration of other medications
Propranolol (Inderal): Starting dose 10–20mg twice daily to 4 ×/day. Useful for
prominent and somatic (as opposed to psychotic) complaints (i.e., palpitations,
trembling, restlessness, motor tension). Note: Not approved for anxiety or other
psychiatric problems
Benzodiazepines: Can be effective for short-term treatment of anxiety while starting
or titrating other medications. No evidence that they are more effective than no
pharmacologic treatment when used for long periods of time. All are equally efficacious.
Indicated for short duration (2–8 weeks). Long-term use results in tolerance, abuse
potential, and rebound anxiety and insomnia
Diazepam (Valium): 15–25mg/day; given its long half-life, there is a lower probability
of withdrawal symptoms compared to other drugs in this class
Lorazepam (Ativan): 0.5–1mg PO BID–TID
Clonazepam (Klonopin): 0.5mg PO BID (may increase to 2–10mg/day); long half-life
without rapid peak levels
Side-effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, ataxia, unsteadiness, memory impairment in elderly
— PART TWO: PANIC DISORDER —
EPIDEMIOLOGY

PSYCH
2–3% prevalence in the general population
Age of onset: Usually 20–24 years-old
Female-to-male ratio: Without agoraphobia (irrational fear of being in open or public
places), 2–3 times more common in women
Co-morbidity with depression, substance use, personality disorders is up to 90%

MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN MIMIC PANIC DISORDER
Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s, SLE, TIA, Wilson’s
Myocardial infarction
Angina
Supraventricular tachycardia
Pulmonary embolus, asthma
Simple partial seizures
Hypoglycemia
477
PSYCH
Pheochromocytoma, Addison’s disease, Cushing’s syndrome
Carcinoid syndrome
Hyperthyroidism
Others: Anemia, hypoparathyroidism, brain neoplasm, Vitamin B12 deficiency, heavy
metal poisoning
TREATMENT: The goals of treating panic attacks include prevention of future attacks and
relief of anticipatory anxiety (which will enable patients overcome avoidance behaviors)
Before initiating treatment, discuss previous therapies (psychotherapy or drugs)
the patient may have encountered, and the results of the particular therapies
This condition may be chronic, so rapid resolution of symptoms may not occur
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): First line treatment, along with CBT
(therapy). All generally started at ½ antidepressant dose
Sertraline (Zoloft): Starting dose of 25–50mg daily; may titrate up to 200mg daily
Paroxetine (Paxil): Starting dose of 10–20mg daily; may titrate up to 40mg daily
Fluoxetine (Prozac): Starting dose of 10–20mg daily; may titrate up to 60mg daily
Citalopram (Celexa): Starting dose of 10–20mg daily; may titrate up to 40mg daily
Escitalopram (Lexapro): Starting dose of 10mg daily; may titrate up to 20mg daily
Fluvoxamine (Luvox): Starting dose of 50mg daily; may titrate up to 150mg daily
Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)
Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR): Starting dose of 37.5mg daily; may titrate up to 225mg
daily
Tricyclic antidepressants: Imipramine and Nortriptyline are preferred as they are less
sedating, have fewer anticholinergic side-effects and less orthostatic hypotension. TCAs
are contraindicated in narrow angle glaucoma, BPH, persons with potential for cardiac
arrhythmias, orthostasis or sedation
Imipramine: 150–200mg daily
Nortriptyline: 50–150mg daily
Desipramine: 150–200mg daily
Clomipramine: 50–150mg daily
β-blocker—Propranolol (Inderal): Starting dose of 10–20mg TID–4 ×/day; may titrate
up to 80mg TID–4 ×/day
Benzodiazepines: Rapid onset of action. Reduce the anticipatory anxiety that most
patients experience with panic disorder. Used most often in the acute setting of panic
disorder especially when symptoms are severely disabling. Long-term use of this class
of drugs is not recommended due to the risks of abuse and/or dependence. Side-effects:
Drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness, cognitive impairment, hypotension
Alprazolam may be started at 0.75–1.5mg/day, with most patients responding to
1.5–6mg (if given in XR, may use daily; otherwise, total daily dose should be divided
TID). Short t½, apt to cause rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. Use with
caution as Alprazolam has the highest level of abuse and street value
Clonazepam may be started at 0.5–1.5mg/day with most patients responding to 1.0–
4.0mg (usually divided into BID dosing)
Lorazepam may be started at 1–2mg/day with most patients responding to 2–6mg
(usually divided into BID dosing)
Diazepam may be started at 10mg/day with most patients responding from 10–60mg
(usually divided into BID dosing)
Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (considered a first line therapy), cognitive
therapy, or group therapy are some nonpharmacologic options for treating panic disorder
Behavioral: Avoidance of places where attacks might occur or if this cannot be done, then
brief exposure initially with increases over time. Avoidance should slowly be confronted.
Continued avoidance could result in serious disability and increased anticipatory anxiety
— PART THREE: OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) —
478
PSYCH
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Prevalence is 1.2% of the general population; similar prevalence in males and females
Age of onset is in the first 19 years of life, 25% start by age of 14 years. It is rare to
develop new cases after 30 years
Course is chronic waxing/waning
Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions as they can be
visualized easily

TREATMENT
Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective psychotherapy
479
PSYCH
method. This should be used in combination with SSRI or TCA, especially if the patient
continues to have sub-optimal response to medication
Medications: OCD is very responsive to serotonergic medications
Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): First line. May take several weeks to
start working. Trials should continue for 8–12 weeks. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. Higher
than usual doses are often needed. Monitor closely for serotonin syndrome
Off-label dosing, see dosing ranges in Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Tricyclic antidepressant
Clomipramine (Anafranil): Starting at 25mg daily, over the first two weeks titrate to
100mg daily in divided doses. Maintenance dose may be given once daily. Max dose
250mg daily
Side-effects in this class include nausea, anorexia, diaphoresis, headache, insomnia
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs)
Venlafaxine (Effexor): Starting at 37.5–75mg once daily; usual adult dose is 150–
300mg; max dose 300mg/day
CLINICAL PEARLS
Separation anxiety disorder in childhood may predispose to depression and anxiety
disorders later in life
Patients with panic disorder and other anxiety disorders are at increased risk for drug
abuse, especially alcohol and anxiolytics. Alcohol, marijuana, opiates often used to self
medicate initially, but leads to secondary problems
Depression screening is helpful to reduce the high risk of co-morbidity with anxiety.
Treatment of depression can help to reduce anxiety
Treatment less likely to be effective with concurrent substance abuse
