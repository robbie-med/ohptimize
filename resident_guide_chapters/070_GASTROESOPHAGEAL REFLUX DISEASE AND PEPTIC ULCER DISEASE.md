70. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE AND
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE
— PART ONE: GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) —
SYMPTOMS
Classically, a burning feeling, rising from the stomach or lower chest and radiating toward
the neck, throat, and occasionally the back. Other symptoms include dysphagia, water
brash, odynophagia, burping, hiccups, nausea, and vomiting. Other patients may be totally
asymptomatic
Extra-esophageal symptoms include chest pain, wheezing, cough, laryngitis, vocal cord
ulceration, leukoplakia, and dental erosion (especially in bulimics)
ETIOLOGY
Incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES): Exacerbating factors include foods
such as onion, fats, mint, EtOH, chocolate, caffeine as well as medications including
anticholinergics, ß-blockers, progesterone containing oral contraceptives, NSAIDs,
Prednisone
Impaired esophageal peristalsis: Associated diseases include CREST, scleroderma,
Raynaud’s, reflux-induced injury
Decreased salivation: Associated conditions include Sjögren’s, cigarette use, and anti-
cholinergic medications
Delayed gastric emptying: Associated conditions include gastroparesis, gastric outlet
obstruction
Increased secretion of gastric acid: Associated conditions include gastrinoma, Zollinger-
Ellison syndrome
Direct irritants: Citrus, tomato, cola, coffee (caffeine will decrease LESP)
Hiatal hernia: Impairs LES function through several mechanisms, as well as impairing
esophageal acid clearance. Reflux is worse in patients having a “nonreducible” hiatal
hernia (where the gastric rugal folds remain above the diaphragm between swallows)
EVALUATION
Empiric treatment may be attempted in patients with typical “uncomplicated” symptoms
(See V.)
Further evaluation, as below, is required in patients with
Atypical symptoms (early satiety, anorexia, dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, chest
pain, asthma, laryngitis)
Patients > 55 with new onset symptoms
Patients whose symptoms persist after 8 weeks of treatment
Patients presenting with complications (anemia, guaiac positive stool, weight loss,
stricture)
Patients treated empirically who partially respond or do not respond should undergo
ambulatory reflux testing using combined multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH or
standard pH
Evaluations include
Upper endoscopy with biopsy: Best assessment of extent of mucosal damage, Barrett’s
esophagus, stricture. Fewer than 50% of patients have endoscopic findings
320
GEN
Upper GI: May identify ulcers or stricture, but is insensitive for reflux
Esophageal motility: Useful assessment of motor function of the esophagus, especially
preoperatively
Gastroesophageal scintigraphy: Noninvasive evaluation of esophageal emptying,
especially useful in pediatric population
Although slightly controversial, there is currently no indication for H. pylori testing in
uncomplicated GERD
Differential diagnosis: Achalasia, Zenker’s diverticulum, gastroparesis, gallstones, peptic
ulcer disease, functional dyspepsia, and angina pectoris
MANAGEMENT
Behavior modification
Avoid foods that are direct irritants or decrease LES pressure (See II. F. Direct irritants
above)
Stop smoking and avoid alcohol
Avoidance, if possible, of drugs that may injure the esophageal mucosa (tetracycline,
quinidine, potassium chloride tablets, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) or decrease sphincter
tone (Theophylline, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics)
Avoidance of large evening meals near bedtime or before exercise
Weight loss
Avoid tight fitting clothes
Remain upright for 3 hours after eating
4–8 inch blocks under head of bed
Antacids provide symptom relief but do not heal esophagitis
H2 blockers: See V. Table
Proton pump inhibitors: See V. Table
Prokinetic agents aid in the competence of LES. They are approximately equivalent to H2
blockers for mild GERD and maintenance: Metoclopramide (Reglan): 10mg PO 4 ×/day,
significant side-effects. Long-term use (> 12 weeks) or high doses (30–40mg 4 ×/day) is
associated with increased risk of developing tardive dyskinesia
Mucosal protective agents: See Part Two of this Chapter, PUD, III. A. 3.
Combinations: PPIs plus Reglan are more effective than PPIs alone
Surgery: Nissen fundoplication is the therapy of choice for patients with strictures
requiring repeated dilation or for patients who fail medical therapy. Surgery has a 90%
efficacy and is especially effective in patients with atypical symptoms such as chronic
cough, asthma, etc. Laparoscopic methods have lower morbidity than the standard open
technique
Device to treat GERD
LINX Reflux Management System was approved by the FDA in 2012
Consists of a series of titanium beads, each with a magnetic core, connected together
with titanium wires to form a ring shape
The LINX device is implanted around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to
strengthen a weak LES muscle
Useful in patients who continue to have symptoms of GERD despite maximum
medical therapy

COMPLICATIONS
Degree of injury is poorly correlated with degree of symptoms
Specific complications include
Esophagitis/ulceration: Seen in < 50% of patients with heartburn. Treatment with PPI
for 4–12 weeks results in healing in most cases. Recurrence rates high after stopping
PPI, requiring continuation of acid suppression
Barrett’s esophagus: In patients with chronic reflux, esophageal squamous cells may
undergo metaplasia to columnar cells. Risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma
increased by 30–125× fold in patient with Barrett’s esophagus. If multiple foci of high
grade dysplasia are found on EGD, elective esophagectomy vs. every 6 month EGDs
with biopsy must be considered. For Barrett’s esophagus metaplasia without dysplasia,
EGD with biopsy should be performed every 1–2 years
Stricture: Barium radiography and an endoscopic evaluation in those with dysphagia
should confirm the stricture (usually at the GE junction) and dilation may be
performed at the same time
Extra-esophageal complications include asthma (aspiration versus vagal), laryngitis,
chronic cough, sleep apnea
Prolonged use of PPIs
Long-term PPI use may reduce the absorption of important nutrients including
Magnesium, Calcium and Vitamin B12, and might reduce the effectiveness of other
medications
FDA warns that taking PPIs together with the anticlotting agent Clopidogrel (Plavix)
can weaken the protective effect of Clopidogrel for heart patients
Long-term use of PPIs has been linked to Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea,
fracture risk, and hypomagnesemia

— PART TWO: PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (PUD) —
SYMPTOMS
Duodenal ulcers frequently present with burning epigastric pain relieved by antacids.
Symptoms may awaken the patient; may be asymptomatic
Gastric ulcers often present with nausea, vomiting, pain made worse by food, early satiety
Nonspecific symptoms include dyspepsia, bloating, gas; may be symptomatic
Alarm symptoms for underlying malignancy or complicated ulcer disease include: Age
> 55 years, rectal bleeding or melena, weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, abdominal mass,
jaundice, family history of gastric cancer, previous history of PUD and anorexia/early
satiety
Diagnosis usually made by endoscopy (preferred) or upper GI
ETIOLOGY
Helicobacter pylori: See below
NSAID use: Clinical ulcers (usually gastric) develop in 1% of patients per year of NSAID
use. Risks of complications include increased age, prior GI disease, concomitant steroid
or anticoagulant use, female sex, and increased dose of NSAIDs. Nonselective NSAIDS
cause inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2, resulting in GI toxicity. Selective COX-
2 inhibitor, Celecoxib (Celebrex), or Meloxicam (Mobic) inhibit COX-2 to a greater
extent than COX-1, leading to better GI safety profile. However, recent reports of CV
complications attributed to COX-2 inhibitors have limited their use
Hypersecretory state: Zollinger Ellison Syndrome, gastrinoma (diagnosed by fasting
serum gastrin level)
Exacerbating factors
Tobacco: One study showed that the risk of duodenal ulcer, failure to heal, and
recurrence was directly proportional to number of cigarettes
Alcohol is a strong stimulant of acid secretion
Corticosteroids
Diet (controversial)
TREATMENT
Acute ulcers
Testing and treatment for H. pylori (See IV.), consider stopping NSAIDs
Antisecretory medications (PPIs and H2 blockers) per Table above; take PPIs on empty
stomach in the morning
Mucosal protective agents (not as effective as H2 blockers)
Sucralfate (Carafate)
Forms a barrier at the ulcer base and stimulates production of mucous, HCO3,
and prostaglandins
Comparable to H2 blockers in healing duodenal ulcers and in GERD
Dose: 1g PO 4 ×/day × 6–8 weeks
Antacids (Mylanta)
Help relieve symptoms and are comparable to H2 blockers in healing duodenal
ulcers and in GERD
Bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) stimulates production of HCO3 and prostaglandins
Maintenance therapy for 2–5 years if frequent symptom recurrence or failure to clear H.
pylori infection
Duodenal ulcers: H2 blockers (or Proton pump inhibitors) given at HS at half treatment
dose (full dose in smokers or complicated disease)—OR—Carafate 1g PO BID
Gastric ulcers: No approved maintenance therapy
NSAID ulcers: If discontinuing NSAIDs is not possible, a PPI (Nexium, Prevacid)
should be given concurrently. Misoprostol (Cytotec) provides some protection. It acts
as a prostaglandin analog and stimulates HCO3 and mucous production. It is dosed at
200mcg PO 4 ×/day with meals. Diarrhea and miscarriage induction limit its use
323
GEN
Patients successfully treated for H. pylori may attempt discontinuation of antisecretory
therapy
HELICOBACTER PYLORI
General
Approximately 30–40% of U.S. population is infected with H. pylori. This bacteria is a
co-factor in 75% of ulcers
Infection causes histological gastritis in almost 100% of patients, PUD, and is a
risk factor in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma (risk increased 9 fold) and
lymphoma
Patients infected have lifetime risk for PUD of approximately 15%
Cure is associated with a reduction of ulcer recurrence and ability to stop antisecretory
therapy
Duodenal ulcers recurred in 6% of those cured of H. pylori and in 67% of those who
remained positive for H. pylori
H. pylori produces large amounts of urease, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown
of urea to alkaline ammonia and carbon dioxide. Through this reaction, the bacterium
may protect itself from acid injury by surrounding itself with alkaline material
More than half of the world’s population is infected with H. pylori. It is likely spread
fecal-oral
Indications for testing
Patients newly diagnosed (endoscopically or radiographically) with ulcer disease
Patients with history of ulcer disease on antisecretory therapy
Patients with ulcer-like dyspepsia
Patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
Screening to prevent gastric cancer if risk factors present
Methods of H. pylori detection
Histological examination (after EGD)
Blood antibody tests
Tests for IgG antibodies to H. pylori
Most convenient but are less accurate
Not able to distinguish active infection (cannot use to monitor efficacy of therapy)
as it may stay positive for years after successful treatment
Urea breath tests (UBTs)
A measure of current infection with a sensitivity of 80–100%
May be falsely negative in patients receiving PPIs or H. pylori therapy. Prior to
testing, stop PPIs for 2 weeks and antibiotics/bismuth for 4 weeks
Stool antigen: Highly sensitive and specific, comparable to UBT
Other
In patients with new onset PUD, if the initial test for H. pylori is negative, another test
should be performed
Factors affecting cure rate include patient compliance, duration of therapy, and
presence of resistance to the antibiotics
Resistance to Metronidazole is 28–39% and to Clarithromycin is 11%. Amoxicillin
and Tetracycline resistant strains are rare
Confirmation of eradication
May be helpful after course of therapy
Use nonendoscopic methods including UBT (antibody test may remain positive for
years after eradication)
Wait 4–6 weeks after completion of therapy
There may be a genetic predisposition
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Approximately 500,000 new cases and 4 million recurrences of peptic ulcers occur in the
U.S. each year
10% of individuals in Western countries will develop a peptic ulcer at some point during
324
GEN
their lifetimes
Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, delays healing and may
predispose to relapses
The prevalence of ulcer disease appears to be increased for patients with alcoholic
cirrhosis but no such association has been established for drinkers without cirrhosis
A link between diet and peptic ulcer disease has not been established
ERADICATION OF H. PYLORI
First-line therapies (See chart on next page)
Treatment failure can be due to compliance and antibiotic resistance. Clarithromycin
resistance is an emerging problem
H. pylori: Helicobacter pylori; PPI: proton pump inhibitor*Lansoprazole 30mg twice daily,
omeprazole 20mg twice daily, pantoprazole 40mg twice daily, or rabeprazole 20 mg twice
daily.·Eradication rates of 70 to 85%.#Eradication rates of 75 to 90%.^ A combination preparation of
bismuth subcitrate-metronidazole-tetracycline is available in the US (trade name Pylera).

COMPLICATIONS OF PUD
Hemorrhage: Symptoms include coffee ground emesis, hematemesis, melena, or
hematochezia
Perforation: Seen in up to 5% of ulcer patients. Usually occurs from ulcers on the anterior
wall of the stomach or duodenum. Patients will usually have absent bowel sounds, rebound
tenderness, and a very rigid abdomen. Upright or decubitus plain abdominal films will aid
in diagnosis (free intraperitoneal air)
Gastric outlet obstruction: Occurs acutely due to inflammation or chronically secondary
to inflammation and healing that lead to scarring of the pylorus or duodenal bulb
Gastric adenocarcinoma
— PART THREE: FUNCTIONAL/NON-ULCER DYSPEPSIA —
SYMPTOMS—Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/abdominal distention or fullness,
nausea, early satiety
ETIOLOGY—Incompletely understood, prevalence around 5–11%
Abnormal central pain processing
Abnormal gastric/duodenal motility
Psychosocial factors: Anxiety, somatization, neuroticism, and depression are increased in
this group
Possibly H. pylori, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia
lamblia, norovirus infection
325
GEN
Medications: NSAIDs, antibiotics, estrogens, narcotics, Digoxin
Systemic illnesses: Post gastroenteritis, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, collagen
vascular diseases
DIAGNOSIS—FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA
Adapted from ROME IV Criteria
Sensation of pain or burning in the epigastrium, early satiety (inability to finish
a normal-sized meal, fullness during or after a meal), or a combination of these
symptoms
Symptoms must be occurring for the last 3 months, with start of symptoms at least 6
months prior to diagnosis
No other organic causes that are likely to explain the symptoms
Those who do not respond to empiric therapy should be referred to GI for EGD/
evaluation (See below)
Those who exhibit alarm signs/symptoms should undergo early EGD: Age > 55 with
new onset dyspepsia, GI blood loss/anemia, weight loss, signs of obstruction (dysphagia,
mass on exam, significant vomiting), severe/persistent pain, family history of gastric or
esophageal cancer

TREATMENT
Options: Previous recommendations for selection based on prevalence above or below
10–15%. Prevalence in U.S. and industrialized countries is 30–40%
Discontinue PPI for ≥1 week. Test for H. pylori; if positive, treat infection
Treat empirically with PPI or H2-receptor antagonist for 4–8 weeks. If no response,
check H. pylori; if positive treat infection
If no response or if experience worse symptoms or relapse: Try tricyclic antidepressant
(Amitriptyline) for 3 months; if no response, refer to GI for EGD/evaluation
Prokinetic agents may be beneficial if postprandial distress is present
Provide dietary advice (e.g., ingestion of small, regular, low-fat meals, and avoidance of
foods that precipitate symptoms)
Address psychological factors
Patient education/reassurance, minimizing use of invasive diagnostic tests: drug therapy
not reliably effective (try switching medications rather than stacking therapy), symptoms
often recur but are not life-threatening
CLINICAL PEARLS
Long-term PPI use may increase fracture risk primarily in age > 50, hypomagnesemia,
clostridium difficile infections and community-acquired pneumonia
Costs in U.S. of treating H. pylori related diseases is $3–5.6 billion/year
Patient education regarding Aspirin and NSAID use is important. Patients should be made
aware of common signs and symptoms of PUD (bleeding, etc.) and instructed to inform the
physician if they should develop
Smoking cessation is imperative in patients with PUD
If patients need to continue NSAIDs despite being diagnosed with PUD, consider COX-2
inhibitors (Celebrex) or shorter acting NSAIDs (so that dosage can be titrated) rather than
the potent once-a-day NSAIDs
Consider Cytotec for prevention of PUD in chronic NSAID users
Three most common reasons for chronic cough are sinusitis, asthma, and GERD
