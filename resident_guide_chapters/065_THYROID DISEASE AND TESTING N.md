65. THYROID DISEASE AND TESTING
Note: These recommendations are for nonpregnant patients
INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): Secreted by the pituitary. Stimulates the steps of
thyroid hormone production
The thyroid gland: Secretes mostly T4 and a small amount of T3
The most active thyroid hormone is T3. About 90% of circulating T3 is derived from
peripheral deiodination of T4
Over 99% of circulating thyroid hormones are bound to proteins, mostly thyroid-
binding globulin (TBG)
Approximately 2% of the adult population has hypothyroidism and another 5–17% have
mild/subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, normal serum free thyroxine)
Approximately 0.2% of the adult population has hyperthyroidism and 0.1–6% has mild/
subclinical hyperthyroidism (decreased TSH, normal free thyroxine)
Screening: The American Thyroid Association recommends that adults be screened for
thyroid dysfunction by measurement of the TSH beginning at age 35 years and every 5
years thereafter. Patients at high risk for thyroid disease should be screened more often
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Hyperthyroidism
Toxic diffuse goiter (Graves’ disease): Most common cause
Iatrogenic illness: Excessive administration of Thyroxine or Triiodothyronine (second
most common cause)
Autonomous toxic adenoma (toxic nodular goiter)
Single adenoma (Plummer’s disease)
Multiple adenomas (toxic multinodular goiter)
Thyroiditis: Inflammation induced release of thyroxine. May be subacute, silent (non-
tender gland) or post-partum
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism: Jod-Basedow disease may occur in patients with
multinodular goiter who take large amounts of iodine; health food preparations;
Amiodarone
Excessive pituitary TSH (TSH secreting pituitary adenoma) or trophoblastic disease
Excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone (Thyrotoxicosis factitia)
Rarely: Thyroid cancer, choriocarcinoma, hydatidiform mole, embryonal testicular
carcinoma, struma ovarii
Hypothyroidism
Primary hypothyroidism
Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis/Chronic lymphocytic
thyroiditis): Most common cause in the U.S.
Surgical removal of the thyroid gland
Radioactive iodine thyroid gland ablation
External irradiation
Thyroid gland iodine organification defect
Idiopathic
Secondary (central) hypothyroidism
Pituitary disease
Hypothalamic disease

GEN
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND LAB ABNORMALITIES
Hyperthyroidism: Severity of symptoms may vary (age of patient, duration of illness,
magnitude of hormone excess)
General: Weight loss, poor sleep, alterations in appetite, fatigue, heat intolerance,
increased sweating, mental disturbances
Eye: Vision change, photophobia, diplopia, exophthalmos
Neck: Possibly thyroid enlargement
Cardio: Palpitations and tachycardia, exertional intolerance/dyspnea on exertion
Neuro: Tremor, sudden paralysis
GYN: Menstrual disturbance (decreased flow), impaired fertility
Extremities: Pretibial myxedema (Graves’ disease)
Hypothyroidism
General: Weight gain, poor sleep, alterations in appetite, fatigue, cold intolerance,
hypothermia, dry or yellow skin, loss of hair, constipation
ENT: Thick tongue
Neck: Possibly thyroid enlargement (goiter)
Cardio: Bradycardia, cardiomyopathy
Neuro: Reflex delay, ataxia, memory and mental impairment, decreased concentration,
depression, myalgias
GYN: Menstrual disturbance (increased flow), impaired fertility
Extremities: Myxedema
Lab abnormalities: In addition to abnormal thyroid tests (See below), increased
cholesterol, increased liver enzymes and CPK, increased prolactin, hyponatremia,
hypoglycemia, anemia (normal or increased MCV)
TECHNIQUE FOR PHYSICAL EXAM OF THE THYROID GLAND
Inspection: Located below the cricoid cartilage, observe while patient is swallowing water
Palpation
Examine from behind the patient
Palpate with 3 fingers on either side of the lower trachea (index fingers just below the
cricoid) for size, shape, consistency, tenderness or nodularity
Examination during swallowing: The thyroid gland moves upward with swallowing and
may be more easily palpated
INTERPRETATION OF LAB TESTS
Introduction
Primary screening test for thyroid abnormalities is TSH (third generation) (See below)
Free T4
FTI (free thyroxine index) is a calculation of the T4 and T3RU (See below) and is an
estimation of the free T4. Used because the T4 level may not be a true indication of a
patient’s thyroid status because it is affected by altered states of protein binding
If the free T4 is measured, FTI (which is an approximation of free T4 ) does not need to
be measured
Definition of commonly obtained thyroid tests
TSH
Third generation assays measure TSH as low as 0.01mU/L. Second generation
assays measure to 0.1mU/L
TSH levels are decreased with
Primary hyperthyroidism (See II. A. Differential diagnosis of
hyperthyroidism)
Thyroid hormone replacement
Severe nonthyroidal illness, pregnancy (1st trimester)
Dopamine, Dopamine agonists (Levodopa) and Glucocorticoids
Subclinical hyperthyroidism (decreased TSH and normal free level T4)
TSH levels are elevated with
Primary hypothyroidism (See II. B. Differential diagnosis of hypothyroidism)
283
GEN
Hyperthyroidism secondary to pituitary neoplastic secretion of thyrotropin
Recovery from nonthyroidal illness
With dopamine antagonists (Metoclopramide), Phenothiazines, Lithium,
Amiodarone, and some antipsychotic
Subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH and normal free T4)
Free T4: Measures the actual free T4. May be falsely elevated in patients receiving
Heparin (especially with dialysis), with depressed patients or with severe nonthyroidal
illness
T4: Measures thyroxine by radioimmunoassay and is affected by states of altered
thyroxine binding. It measures both circulating thyroxine bound to protein and active
(unbound) thyroxine
T3: For diagnosis of T3 thyrotoxicosis (thyrotoxicosis with normal T4 values). Like
T4, only measures bound T3. Not useful in hypothyroidism. Obtain when suspect
thyrotoxicosis in patients with low TSH and normal or low T4 (T3 toxicosis)
Serum thyroglobulin: Storage site for thyroid hormones. Elevated in hyperthyroidism
and thyroiditis. Reduced or undetectable in thyrotoxicosis factitia (exogenous thyroid
hormone suppresses endogenous production)
Thyroid antibodies: Found in 5–10% of normal subjects and 20% of hospitalized
patients
Antimicrosomal antibodies: Elevated in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’ disease
Antithyroglobulin antibodies: Elevated in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’
disease
OTHER TESTS
Calcitonin assay: Useful serum marker in medullary thyroid carcinoma. May also be
elevated in azotemia, hypercalcemia, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and pregnancy as well
as other malignancies
Radioiodine (123I) Uptake and scan of thyroid gland: Provides a picture of thyroid
uptake
Elevated: Graves’ disease, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, dietary iodine
deficiency, pregnancy, early Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, nephrotic syndrome, recovery
from thyroid hormone suppression, recovery from subacute thyroiditis, some thyroid
enzyme deficiencies
Decreased: Administration of iodine (including drugs, contrast dyes, etc.), antithyroid
drugs, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid hormone administration, severe (high turnover)
Graves’ disease, thyroid gland damage (thyroiditis, surgery, radioiodine), ectopic
functioning thyroid tissue
Ultrasound: To differentiate solid from cystic nodules. Purely cystic are usually not cancer
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) thyroid biopsy: See X. D. below

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTHYROIDISM
Graves’ disease (Basedow’s disease): Guidelines below are for non-pregnant patients
Diagnosis
Caused by thyroid stimulating antibodies which bind to and activate the
thyrotropin receptor on thyroid cells
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism, low TSH, high free T4, elevated antithyroglobulin
and antimicrosomal antibodies, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland
Approach
Drugs: If mild or moderate hyperthyroidism/small or moderately enlarged thyroid
gland, then consider use of antithyroid drugs. If relapse while on drugs, then
proceed to definitive radioiodine therapy
Radioiodine therapy: If markedly elevated serum thyroxine, goiter > 4 times
normal size or serum triiodothyronine:thyroxine ratio > 20:1, then proceed to
definitive therapy with radioiodine
Antithyroid drugs: Perform follow-up thyroid testing in 4–6 weeks
Methimazole (Tapazole): Preferred agent
Less frequent dosing than Propylthiouracil and lower incidence of acute
hepatic necrosis
Initially 15–30mg PO daily and then decrease dose as symptoms resolve and
free T4 returns to normal, maintenance 5–10mg/day
Propylthiouracil (PTU)
Drug of choice in breastfeeding or pregnancy (use lower doses)
285
GEN
Blocks peripheral conversion of T4 to T3
Dose 300mg PO daily in 3 divided doses and then decrease dose as symptoms
resolve and free T4 returns to normal, maintenance: 100–200mg/day
Side-effects: Minor skin rashes, rarely agranulocytosis, acute hepatic necrosis
Symptomatic relief: β-blockers (Propranolol)
Symptomatic relief until hyperthyroidism is resolved. It has no effect on thyroid
hormone secretion
Radioactive iodine
May be given in an ablative dose (with life-long thyroid replacement therapy
necessary) or in a smaller dose to attempt to induce a euthyroid state
Elderly or patients with cardiac history may benefit from treatment with
antithyroid drugs before radioactive iodine therapy (to deplete the gland of stored
hormone)
Contraindicated in pregnancy
Patients usually become hypothyroid by 3 months. May require partial thyroid
replacement 2 months after radioactive iodine treatment. Note: TSH may not be a
good indicator of thyroid status for the first several months after treatment
Frequency of follow-up: 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, then, if thyroid status has
normalized (with replacement therapy), every 1–2 years
Surgery: Not commonly performed in the U.S., but may be appropriate with pregnant
women intolerant of antithyroid drugs or pediatric patients
Toxic solitary thyroid nodules
Definition:A single hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule causing hyperthyroidism
Symptomatic: Propranolol with doses as above in Graves’ disease
Definitive treatment
Radioactive iodine: Permanent hypothyroidism occurs in less than 10% of patients
Surgery: If radioactive iodine is contraindicated or < 40
Toxic multinodular goiter
General: Usually affects older patients
Symptomatic: Propranolol with dose as above in Graves’ disease
Antithyroid medications: 95% recurrence rate after thioureas are stopped
Definitive treatment
Radioactive iodine: Thiourea treatment before iodine. Requires high doses of
radioactive iodine. Need close follow-up to monitor for recurrence
Surgery: Reserved for cosmetic purposes or pressure symptoms
Subacute thyroiditis
General: Painless inflammation of the thyroid gland lasting weeks to months causing
transient hypo-or hyperthyroidism. Subsides spontaneously
Symptomatic hyperthyroidism: Propranolol 10–40mg PO 4 ×/day
Treat transient hypothyroidism with Levothyroxine 0.05–0.1mg PO daily if
symptomatic
Antithyroid medication and radioactive iodine are ineffective as thyroid hormone
production is low
Suppurative (bacterial) thyroiditis
Often occurs during course of systemic infection
Antibiotics: Empiric therapy
Surgical drainage if fluctuant
Thyrotoxicosis factitia
Occurs from exogenous ingestion of thyroid hormone
If it is suspected, then check serum thyroglobulin. The thyroglobulin level is reduced
or undetectable in thyrotoxicosis factitia (exogenous thyroid hormone suppresses
endogenous production)
Manage with patient education or psychiatric referral
Mild/subclinical hyperthyroidism (also called compensated hypothyroidism, decreased
thyroid reserve, and prehypothyroidism)
Definition: Low TSH and normal free T4
286
GEN
These patients have a 3 fold higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation within 10 years
and some may be at risk of developing thyroid induced osteoporosis
Should be treated if associated with toxic goiter, toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular
goiter. If asymptomatic, should probably not be treated. Follow closely
MANAGEMENT OF HYPOTHYROIDISM
Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis): Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis
Most common thyroid disorder in the U.S. Thyroid gland is usually diffusely enlarged,
firm and finely nodular
Thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroid peroxidase) are positive 95% of the time.
Antithyroglobulin antibodies are increased 60% of the time
Management
Elderly or patients with coronary disease: Start with Levothyroxine (Synthroid,
Levothroid) 0.025mg PO daily (This dosage can be increased in the increments of
0.025–0.050mg every 4–6 weeks until TSH level returns to normal)
Young patients/healthy patient: Start with Levothyroxine (Synthroid) 0.05– 0.1mg
PO daily, with the dosage increased as indicated by TSH levels
Note: Older patients generally require ⅔the amount as younger patients
Follow-up: Once TSH normalizes and patient is asymptomatic, then check TSH every
1–2 years
Half-life of T4 is about 7 days. Check TSH level 6–8 weeks after a change in dosage
of thyroid replacement. Early testing may lead to over-treatment
Surgical removal of the thyroid gland
Hypothyroidism develops in 25% at 8–12 years post-op in patients with subtotal
thyroidectomy
Management as above
Radioactive iodine thyroid gland ablation
Hypothyroidism develops at rate of 2–5% /year (30–70% at 10–15 years after
treatment)
Management as above
Subclinical hypothyroidism
Normal free T4 and high TSH
Longitudinal progression to hypothyroidism of 5–8% /year in patients with high TSH
and significant titer of antimicrosomal antibodies. Incidence of hypothyroidism in
patients over age 65 is 80% over 4 years
Indications for Levothroid replacement therapy
All patients with elevated TSH and a significant titer of antimicrosomal antibodies
Elderly patients with TSH greater than 20μU/mL (20mU/L) and a negative
antimicrosomal antibody test
Patients with elevated TSH and goiter (+/- antimicrosomal antibodies)
History of radioiodine treatment for thyrotoxicosis and elevated TSH
Consider in symptomatic and pregnant patients with elevated TSH: Start at sub-
therapeutic dose of 0.05–0.075mg PO daily
If treatment is not initiated, then follow closely
DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF SOLITARY THYROID NODULES
Enlargement of the thyroid gland may be diffuse or nodular and is detectable in 4%
of adults. Most thyroid nodules are benign, less than 5% are malignant. If an incidental
nodule > 1cm is found, then consider fine needle aspiration. Solitary nodules are associated
with higher incidence of malignancy
Risk factors for thyroid cancer
History: Age < 20 or > 45, male, exposure to ionizing radiation (especially in
childhood), family history
Physical exam: Cervical lymphadenopathy, vocal cord paralysis, very firm nodule,
rapid tumor growth, fixation to adjacent structures
Factors which do not differentiate benign from malignant nodules
287
GEN
History and physical exam
Thyroid function tests
Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies
Ultrasound: May differentiate solid from cystic, but either may be malignant
Thyroid radioiodine uptake and scan: May differentiate between a “cold”
(nonfunctioning) nodule which is more likely to be malignant, and a “hot” (functioning
nodule) which is less likely to be malignant, but does not definitively distinguish
between benign and malignant nodules
Fine needle aspiration (FNA): Test of choice
Safe, reliable, inexpensive and is performed as an outpatient
Technique
No anesthesia necessary
Aspiration with 25 gauge needle. Success is increased by ultrasound guidance
Results
If positive (suspicious or malignant), then referral for definitive therapy (surgery)
If indeterminate, then consider one of the following
Repeat FNA
Radionuclide scanning: If “hot” then follow and if “cold” then surgery—OR—
Trial of suppression therapy with monthly follow-up over 6 months
If size increases, then surgery
If size decreases, then follow
If size does not change, then consider surgery or repeat FNA
If inadequate, consider referral for surgical excision in patients with one or more risk
factors
If benign, then trial of suppression therapy with monthly follow-up over 6 months
GOITER
Differential diagnosis
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Iodide deficiency
Genetic thyroid hormone defects
Drug-induced goiter: Lithium, Iodide, PTU, Methimazole, Phenylbutazone,
Sulfonamides, Amiodarone
Infiltrating diseases: Cancer, sarcoidosis
Evaluation
History and physical exam as above
Obtain TSH, Free T4
Consider thyroid radioiodine uptake and scan
Consider ultrasound and FNA if nodule(s) are present
Management: Per specific diagnosis
CLINICAL PEARLS
Approximately 5% of the world’s population have goiter, mostly from iodine deficiency
Free T4 represents about 0.025% of total T4 (bound and unbound)
Amiodarone causes clinically significant hypothyroidism in about 8% of patients
and asymptomatic hypothyroidism in another 17% of patients due to the high iodine
concentration (TSH high and T4 low or normal)
Use caution with diagnosis of hospitalized patients. Up to 70% of moderately ill
hospitalized patients will have thyroid function abnormalities
Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis vary with age and may be atypical, especially in the elderly
