41. TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING
TRANSMISSION
Tuberculosis (TB) is spread primarily through respiratory droplets which may remain
airborne within a room for hours after a cough or sneeze. In 6–12 weeks most people
infected with TB develop cell-mediated immunity which halts the spread of infection. The
PPD (purified protein derivative of TB) test becomes positive by 12 weeks. Approximately
10% of those infected with TB will develop active TB infection at some time in their life
HIGH RISK POPULATIONS
Contacts of people with infectious TB
IV drug users
Medical risk factors/Immunosuppressed: HIV/AIDS, DM, chronic steroid use,
immunosuppressive therapies, CRF or hemodialysis, malignancy, silicosis, weight >
10% below ideal body weight, gastrectomy, jejunoileal bypass, CXR with fibrotic lesions
consistent with old TB, silicosis, solid organ transplant, head and neck cancer, specialized
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease
Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings: Prisons, nursing homes,
healthcare facilities, homeless shelters, residential settings for HIV+ persons
Immigrants from high prevalence countries in the past 5 years (most countries in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe) or extended travel in high-incidence countries.
Recent TST converters (i.e., persons with baseline testing results who have an increase of
10mm or more in the size of the TST reaction within a 2-year period)
Infants and children under the age of 5 who have a positive TB test result
SCREENING
All high-risk individuals should be screened annually
All pregnant women at high risk should be screened
Exceptions to routine screening include
Documented skin test positive in past
Prior course of treatment for positive skin test
The CDC recommends screening with either TST or IGRA. IGRA is preferred for
patients who have received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination or those who may be
unlikely to return for TST interpretation
TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST (TST)
PPD (Mantoux)
Mantoux TB skin test is the standard test
TST is the preferred method of testing for children under the age of 5 years
0.1mL PPD is injected intradermal into the inner forearm. When placed correctly, the
injection should produce a wheal of 6–10mm in diameter
The skin test reaction should be read between 48–72 hours after administration
The reaction should be measured and recorded in mm of the induration (not area of
redness). The diameter of the indurated area should be measured across the forearm
(perpendicular to the long axis). Recording the “positive” or “negative” is not
sufficient, the measurement of induration must also be included
Negative skin test: Does not exclude TB infection. A reaction may not occur in patients
who are immunocompromised, severe febrile illness, virus vaccinations (MMR, OPV),
malnutrition, old age, overwhelming TB infections and HIV disease

Two-step TST (Booster phenomenon)
Explanation: Repeated testing of uninfected individuals does not sensitize them to
tuberculin. However, delayed sensitivity to tuberculin (a positive test) may wane over
time. Certain individuals who were exposed to TB early in their life may have no
reaction many years later (false negative). In these individuals, it is necessary to do 2
tests, 1 week apart. If the second test (performed 1–2–3 weeks later) is positive, this
represents a booster phenomenon (remote infection) and not a recent conversion
Indications: Indicated for the initial screening of residents and employees of long-term
care facilities and others who will be receiving yearly skin testing. It is done to avoid
misinterpreting a boosted reaction as a recent infection
CRITERIA FOR A POSITIVE TB SKIN TEST
An induration of ≥5mm is considered positive in
HIV-infected persons
A recent contact of a person with TB disease
Persons with fibrotic changes on chest x-ray consistent with prior TB
Patients with organ transplants
Persons who are immunosuppressed such as taking > 15mg/day of Prednisone × ≥1
months, taking TNF-α antagonists
An induration of ≥10mm is considered positive in
Recent immigrants (< 5 years) from high-prevalence countries
Injection drug users
Residents and employee of high-risk congregate setting
Mycobacteriology lab personnel
Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk
Children < 4 years of age or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk
categories
An induration of ≥15mm is considered positive in any person, including persons with no
known risk factors for TB
INTERFERON-GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY (IGRA)
IGRA detects sensitization to M. tuberculosis by measuring IFN-gamma release in
response to antigens representing M. tuberculosis. Results can be available within 24 hours
IGRAs approved by the FDA: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) and
T-SPOT.TB test (T-Spot)
Positive IGRA: The person has been infected with TB. Additional tests are needed to
determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease
Negative IGRA: Latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely
IGRAs are preferred method of TB infection testing for
People who have received BCG (as a vaccine or for cancer therapy).
People who have a difficult time returning for a second visit to have TSTs read
Limitation of IGRAs
Blood sample must be processed within 8–30 hours after collection
Limited data exist on use in groups such as children < 5 years of age, persons recently
exposed to TB, immunocompromised persons, and those who will be tested repeatedly
Higher cost
One advantage is that results can be obtained after a single visit
CDC does not recommend using IGRA to confirm positive TST results but you may
consider use of IGRA in addition to TST in specific circumstances with assessing
discordant test results in combination with clinical judgement and considering the patient’s
risk of infection, of developing active disease, and of poor outcomes
TREATMENT OF LATENT TB INFECTION (LTBI)—PER CDC RECOMMENDATIONS
Careful evaluation for active disease must precede initiation of treatment for LTBI.
Individuals with LTBI would have a positive TST or IGRA result, normal chest x-ray, and
no symptoms or physical findings suggestive of TB disease
164
ID
Decisions to treat latent infection should consider the individual patient’s risk for the
development of active tuberculosis and the side-effects of treatment
There are several treatment regimens available. Selection of appropriate regimen is
based on drug-susceptibility results of the presumed source case if known, co-existing
medical illness, and potential for drug-drug interactions
Directly observed therapy (DOT) for LTBI should be considered for persons who are
at especially high risk for TB disease and are suspected of nonadherence or are given an
intermittent dosing regimen
Medications
Isoniazid (INH) regimens
9 months
Once daily: Preferred for persons living with HIV, children age 2–11, pregnant
women (concurrent treatment with pyridoxine/Vitamin B6 supplements)
Twice weekly: Preferred for DOT in pregnant women
6 months: Interval may be daily or twice weekly when combined with DOT
Isoniazid and Rifapentine (RPT) regimen
Duration 3 months at an interval of once weekly with DOT
Treatment in persons 12 years or older
NOT recommended for persons who are: Under age 2, living with HIV/AIDS
taking anti-retroviral treatment (ART), presumed infected with INH or RIF-
resistant M. Tuberculosis and women who are pregnant or expect to become
pregnant within the 12 week regimen
Rifampin (RIF) regimen
Duration 4 months at a daily interval
Considered for persons who cannot tolerate INH or who have been exposed to
INH-resistant TB indicated for HIV-infected persons
Not indicated for HIV-infected persons taking ART

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INH
LFT elevation
Occurs in 10–20% of patients taking INH
Withheld INH if LFT level > 3 × the upper limit of normal if associated with
symptoms or 5× the upper limit of normal if patient is asymptomatic
Hepatitis
Occurs in about 0.1% of people taking INH; more common when INH is combined
with other hepatotoxic drugs
Other risk factors include daily alcohol consumption, underlying liver disease or risks
for liver disease, and concurrent use of other medications which are metabolized in the
liver
Peripheral neuropathy
Occurs in < 0.2% of people taking INH at conventional doses
More common in people with conditions associated with neuropathy such as diabetes,
HIV, renal failure, and alcoholism
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 10–25mg/day supplementation is recommended in conditions
associated with neuropathy, or to prevent neuropathy in pregnant or breastfeeding
women

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF RIFAMPIN (RIF) AND RIFAPENTINE (RPT)
Hepatotoxicity occurs in 0.6% of patients taking RIF. It is more likely when RIF is
combined with INH
Cutaneous reactions, such as pruritis, can occur in 6% of patients taking RIF—generally
self-limited and may not be a true hypersensitivity reaction; continued treatment may be
possible
Rifamycins (Rifampin, Rifapentine) are rarely associated with hypersensitivity reactions
(hypotension, nephritis, or thrombocytopenia)
GI symptoms include nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain
Orange discoloration of body fluids is expected and harmless. Advise patients before-
hand. Soft contact lenses and dentures may be permanently stained
RIF and RPT interact with many other medications, including methadone, warfarin,
hormonal contraceptives, and phenytoin
RIF should not be used in HIV patients taking certain antiretroviral drugs. Rifabutin may
substitute RIF in the 4-month regimen. RPT should not be used in HIV patients taking
ARTs
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF LTBI
Those with recent exposure to a person with known or suspected infectious TB should be
evaluated immediately for LTBI and TB disease
If the TST or IGRA result is positive, treat with a regimen according to drug
susceptibility
Those who have negative TST or IGRA results should be retested in 8–10 weeks after
exposure has ended. However, if the chest x-ray is normal, LTBI treatment should be
initiated in TST-negative children ≥5 year of age and in immunocompromised persons
of all ages who have negative TST or IGRA results. Treatment should be continued
until the results of the second test and other medical evaluation are known. For some
high-risk contacts, a full course of LTBI treatment may be recommended. Consult the
local TB control program for the management of such contacts
HIV-infected persons receiving ART should receive 9-month regimen of INH
Pregnancy
Consider immediate treatment for LTBI if the woman is HIV infected or a recent
contact, and monitor
In the absence of risk factors, wait until after the woman has delivered to avoid
administering unnecessary medication during pregnancy
INH daily or twice weekly (using DOT) is the preferred regimen
Supplement with Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 10–25mg/day
The 12-dose regimen is not recommended
There is potential for an increased hepatotoxicity during pregnancy and the first 2–3
months of the postpartum period. Consider delaying treatment until 2–3 months post-
partum unless there is a risk of progression to TB disease
Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in women taking INH. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)
10–25mg/day is recommended for nursing mothers and for breastfed infants
Infants and children < 5 years of age with LTBI have been recently infected and therefore
at high risk for progression to disease
Test adults in close social contact with the child to find the person with infectious TB
disease
The preferred regimen for children (age 2–11 year) is 9 months of daily INH. The risk
of INH-related hepatitis in this population is minimal. Routine LFT monitoring is not
necessary unless the child has risk factors for hepatotoxicity
