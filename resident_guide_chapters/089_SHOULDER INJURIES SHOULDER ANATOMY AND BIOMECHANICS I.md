89. SHOULDER INJURIES
SHOULDER ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS
Introduction: Normal shoulder function is a combination of the anatomic arrangement
and the complex action of many muscles. The shoulder is the joint with the largest range of
motion, but this allows for more instability. A single small injury to the shoulder may lead
to functional deficit which potentiates damage to other structures
Anatomy
Sternoclavicular joint (synovial joint)
Acromioclavicular joint
Glenohumeral joint
Humeral head
Glenoid fossa
Glenohumeral ligaments
Rotator cuff muscles (“SITS”: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis)
Scapula rotators (trapezius, rhomboids, levator scapulae, serratus anterior)
History: See history under each specific diagnosis
Physical exam
Inspect for asymmetry and deformity of shoulder girdle
Palpate for tenderness and crepitus
Range of motion
Neck and elbow exam, including c-spine exam (to exclude referred pain)
Neurovascular exam of bilateral upper extremities
Apprehension test: Most sensitive finding with shoulder instability
Method: With patient in supine position apply anterior force to the humerus with
external rotation
Result: Pain (apprehension) of impending subluxation suggests anterior
glenohumeral instability
Relocation test
Method: With patient in supine position apply posterior force to the humerus with
external rotation
Result: Relief of pain or apprehension suggests anterior glenohumeral instability
Sulcus sign
Method: With patient in sitting position, apply downward traction to the humerus
Result: Development of a sulcus between the greater tuberosity of the humerus
and acromion suggests posterior glenohumeral instability
Apley scratch test
Method: Patient attempts to touch the superior and inferior aspects of the opposite
scapula
Result: Loss of range of motion suggests rotator cuff disease
Drop arm test
Method: Arms are passively abducted and patient slowly lowers arm to waist
Result: If arm drops to side, suggests rotator cuff disease
Empty can test
Method: Elbows extended with arms abducted in scapular plane and thumbs
pointing downward. The patient attempts to elevate arms against resistance
Results: Pain or weakness suggests supraspinatus injury or tear
Hawkins-Kennedy test
406
MUSC
Method: Forward flexion of shoulder to 90°, elbow flexion 90°, and internal
rotation of shoulder
Result: Pain suggests supraspinatus tendon impingement
Neer test
Method: Arm is fully extended and placed in internal rotation, then forward flexed
through full arm flexion
Results: If pain is invoked, suggests subacromial impingement
Impingement test
Method: 10cc of 1% Lidocaine is injected into the subacromial space and Neer test
is repeated
Results: Relief of pain after injection suggests impingement
Yergason test
Method: Elbow flexed to 90°, patient supinates against resistance
Results: Pain with supination suggests biceps tendon instability or tendonitis
Speeds test
Method: Shoulder flexed to 90° and supinated, patient resists downward force of
examiner applied to palm
Results: Pain at anterior shoulder suggests biceps tendon instability or tendonitis
Cross arm test
Method: Elevate arm to 90° and actively adduct
Results: Pain suggests acromioclavicular joint disorder
SHOULDER INSTABILITY
Introduction: Shoulder instability (symptomatic abnormal glenohumeral translation) is
common problem, especially in overhead athletes. Anterior instability is the most common
and can range from subluxation to complete dislocation. Instability can also result from
repetitive microtrauma as the ligaments are stretched
History
Anterior: Shoulder is usually abducted and externally rotated. Force is applied to arm
causing more external rotation and extension. This event is very painful and athlete
may feel shoulder slide out of place. Athlete may have associated symptoms of a “dead
arm” for seconds to minutes following the event
Posterior: Shoulder is usually in flexed, adducted, and internally rotated position and a
force applied to hand causes posterior dislocation. Typically happens with falls and in
offensive linemen in football
Multidirectional or recurrent: Pain is usual complaint that brings patients to see
doctor. These injuries can masquerade as many other injuries because of disrupted
biomechanics of shoulder
Physical exam
Positive apprehension test and sulcus sign
With recurrent injuries check for signs of nerve palsies. There may also be loss of
internal rotation (10°) and crepitus with ROM. Think of impingement as a sign of
instability (injection test)
Radiography
Plain films
MRI: Most useful with recurrent instability and determining associated complications
(labral tears, chondral defects)
Management
Shoulder dislocation
Multiple techniques including modified hippocratic (traction-countertraction),
Rowe maneuver (touch opposite ear), Stimson (prone with traction weights)
Post-reduction repeat plain films and immobilize 2–6 weeks. Rehabilitation
includes early isometrics. Goal to reduce recurrent dislocations

MUSC
Chronic instability
Protect shoulder from provocative movements, and regain ROM and normal
shoulder function with physical therapy. Gradual return to sport specific exercise
and play. Plan 3–6 months of therapy
Surgical indications: Irreducible acutely, displaced tuberosity fracture, unstable
glenoid rim fracture, absolute stabilization needed prior to return to sport, and loss
of time not an option
Clinical pearls
Ensure good on-field exam before reduction
Shoulder pain is the most common symptom of shoulder instability
Younger age of initial dislocation leads to increased risk of re-dislocation
When you think of impingement, think of chronic instability
Asymptomatic laxity can be a normal variant, but may lead to chronic instability
ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE
History: Symptoms can range from minimal to marked pain limiting function and
decreased range of motion. Special attention should be given to throwing athletes because
they are prone to overuse injuries. Chronic tendonitis may present with night pain
Physical exam
Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of humerus and painful abduction of arm.
Positive drop arm test, supraspinatus test, and impingement testing
Weakness or pain with internal or external rotation
Radiography
Plain films:AP and lateral films, often helpful to rule out other causes of shoulder pain
Ultrasound: Can detect tendon tears with good sensitivity and specificity but is
operator dependent
MRI may be used in either the acute or chronic tear if rehabilitation has failed. MRI is
89–96% sensitive and 49–100% specific for rotator cuff tear
Management
Acute tears: Begin with conservative treatment (rest, ice, and NSAIDs). Rehabilitation
program to be started in 1–2 weeks. If not improved, consider MRI and surgical
referral. Refer patients with suspected tear, especially young, active, healthy patients
with full-thickness tear
Chronic tears: Begin with a stretching and strengthening program, avoiding overhead
activities. Consider ice, heat, massage and ionophoresis. Consider NSAIDs and/or
corticosteroid injection. If patient improves, slowly work in overhead activities and
then sport specific activities. Consider MRI and surgical referral with continued pain
Clinical pearls
Rehabilitation (physical therapy) is the most important part of treatment
A partial thickness tear may progress to full thickness tear and can lead to atrophy of
rotator cuff muscles and irreparable damage.
Age is one of the great dividers in this injury
IMPINGEMENT
Introduction: There are 2 reasons for impingement: Increase in volume of the structures
in the space (muscle hypertrophy, inflammation, trauma) and decreased available space
(fibrositis, osteophyte, convex acromion)
History: Patients present with a toothache-like pain in shoulder. Worse with overhead
movements. Inquire about past history of any injuries to the shoulder (subluxations or
rotator cuff) and any medical problems (inflammatory diseases). Night pain is common
Physical exam: Findings are consistent with early rotator cuff disease. Patient should not
have any weakness of the cuff muscles. Positive impingement sign and Neer sign
Radiography: May indicate anatomic variations in acromions predisposed to impingement
Management: Relative rest with avoidance of overhead (greater than 90°) movements.
Physical therapy for stretching and strengthening of muscles. NSAIDs followed by
