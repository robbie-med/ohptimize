107. DEPRESSION
INTRODUCTION
Lifetime prevalence is 17%; 12-month prevalence is 6.6%; 15% commit suicide; many
are not recognized, many are incompletely treated. The incidence is similar to patients with
ischemic heart disease
Proven therapies (pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic) are available with 50–60%
responding to any individual antidepressants and 80% responding to at least 1 medication
Recurrent episodes of depression occur in 75%–85%. One-third of patients will have
another episode within 1 year of stopping treatment and ½ will have another episode in
their lifetimes
SCREENING
USPSTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult population
USPSTF recommends screening adolescents 12 to 18 years for major depression
The PHQ-2 is acceptable as initial screening for depression in all age groups. If answers
to either of the questions is positive, then proceed to establish diagnosis according to full
DSM-V criteria listed below. The two questions are
During the past 2 weeks, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or
hopeless?
During the past 2 weeks, have you often been bothered by having little interest or
pleasure in doing things?
DIAGNOSIS
DSM-V Criteria for major depression
At least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2 week period
and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is
depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure
Depressed mood most of the day
Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day
Significant weight loss or weight gain or a decrease or increase in appetite
Insomnia or hypersomnia
Psychomotor agitation or retardation
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
Diminished ability to think or concentrate
Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or
a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide
The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning
The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (drug of
abuse or prescribed medication) or a general medical condition
A mnemonic for symptoms of major depression is: SIG E CAPS
S – Sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia)
I – Interest (loss of interest)
G – Guilt
E – Energy (feeling of fatigue)
C – Concentration (inability to concentrate)
481
PSYCH
A – Appetite (increased or decreased)
P – Psychomotor (agitation or retardation)
S – Suicidality (ideation, plan)
Diagnosis may be missed if patient presents with anorexia, weight loss, constipation,
problems with sleeping, loss of libido, or other somatic complaints including pain (or
vague aches and pains)
MEDICAL CAUSES OF DEPRESSION
Endocrine: Hypo-or hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing’s disease, diabetes,
Addison’s disease, or menopause
Infectious: AIDS, tertiary syphilis, tuberculosis, mononucleosis, or hepatitis
Inflammatory: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis and other
connective tissue diseases
Neurologic: Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease, complex partial seizures, CNS
tumors, dementia, stroke, or head injuries
Nutritional: Vitamin deficiencies (Vitamin B12, folate, niacin, thiamine, or C)
Pharmacologic: ß-blockers, corticosteroids, contraceptives, Cimetidine (Tagamet),
Phenothiazines, α-methyldopa, anticholinesterases or interferon
Post-MI, pancreatic tumors, paraneoplastic syndromes
MANAGEMENT: General considerations
Antidepressant medications and structured psychotherapy are both effective treatments
and may be combined if not effective alone
Patients with dysthymia may also respond to antidepressant therapy
Bereavement may lead to major depression and patient with depressive symptoms
persisting more than 2 months should be offered therapy
Other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, mania, psychosis, and substance use may
co-exist with major depression
Patients should be assessed for suicidal tendencies by asking: “Do you ever think of
hurting yourself or taking your own life?” If the answer is yes, then ask: “Do you currently
have a plan?” If the answer is yes, then ask “What is your plan?”
Risk factors for suicide include age > 65, male, white or Native American, single,
divorced, separated or widowed, unemployed, history of psychiatric admission, family or
personal history of suicide attempt, drug or alcohol use, recent severely stressful life event,
panic attacks or severe anxiety, severe physical illness, severe hopelessness or anhedonia,
specific plan, access to firearms or other lethal means
Choice of antidepressant medications: No specific medications have been proven most
effective for major depression, but certain medications will also work for co-existing
conditions (panic, obsessive-compulsive, pain) and some have more side-effects than
others. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become widely prescribed
secondary to their favorable side-effect profile. General considerations include:
Select a medication by taking into account side-effects, interactions, treatment of co-
existing conditions, and cost
Start a med gradually and increase dose over 5–10 days
Follow-up: Re-evaluate patient every 1–2 weeks for acute phase of treatment (first
6–10 weeks). Although the full therapeutic effect may not occur for 4–6 weeks, if there
is no effect after 3–4 weeks, then increase the dose. If still inadequate response, then:
Change to a new SSRI if SSRI was chosen initially
Combine 2 antidepressants from different classes
Change to different class of antidepressant or augment treatment
Augment treatment with Lithium, atypical antipsychotic agent, Lamotrigine or T3
Additional measures if unsuccessful include psychotherapy (at any time during
treatment) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
Duration of therapy: Average treatment duration is 6 months for an episode. Patients
with 2 or more episodes of major depression lasting more than 2 years should continue
medications for at least 2 years and possibly for life. Patients and family should be

PSYCH
informed about the high risk for subsequent episodes. Early discontinuation (treatment
duration < 6 months) is associated with 77% higher risk of relapse (compared to
continuing treatment)
SSRIs
Fluoxetine (Prozac) has the longest half-life and should be used with caution in
patients with bipolar disorder as it can aggravate the manic state. It is the only
SSRI approved use and effective in children and adolescents
See dosing recommendations in Generalized Anxiety Disorder section
SSRI’s are less effective than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective
norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors for depression with physical symptoms or pain
Failure to respond to a specific SSRI does not predict nonresponse to another
SSRI. If stopping short-acting serotonergic medications (e.g., Citalopram,
Paroxetine, Sertraline, or Venlafaxine), then gradually decrease dose to prevent a
discontinuation syndrome which may include tinnitus, vertigo, or paresthesias
Vilazodone (Viibryd), a 5HT1A receptor agonist is a new drug approved for MDD.
Dose: 10mg daily × 7 days, then titrate by doubling the dose every 7 days to the
final dose of 40mg daily
Tricyclic antidepressants
Avoid using in patients with ischemic heart disease or arrhythmias
Obtain EKG before starting in patients > 50 and repeat EKG before increasing
dose if first-degreeAV block or bundle branch block
Bupropion (Wellbutrin) may increase the risk of seizures with daily dose exceeding
450mg for XR formulation, 400mg for SR, or single dose > 150mg for IR formulation
Trazodone (Desyrel) may rarely cause priapism
Venlafaxine (Effexor), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq),
Levomilnacipran (Fetzima)—(dual action antidepressant) has higher rates of remission
than SSRIs or TCAs in severe depression. Effective for treatment of chronic pain. Only
Duloxetine has the indication for chronic pain
Desvenlafaxine 50mg daily
Levomilnacipran 20mg × 2 days, then increase by increments of 40mg daily every
2 days as needed to max 120mg daily
Vortioxetine (Brintellix), a SSRI, 5HT1A agonist and 5HT3 antagonist. Dose: 10mg
daily, then increase to 20mg daily. In 2D6 poor metabolizers, use only 10mg daily. Has
many drug interactions
Additional selected commonly used antidepressants: Amitriptyline (Elavil),
Citalopram (Celexa), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Mirtazapine
(Remeron) and Nortriptyline (Pamelor)
Discontinuing therapy: Medications should be slowly decreased over 2–3 months
with monthly follow-up to telephone consultation. If depression recurs, then restart
medications for additional 3–6 months
Other therapies
Exercise: May be as effective as SSRI, but longer onset of action with exercise
Cognitive-behavioral therapy: Identifying any pessimistic or self-critical thoughts
and decreasing behavior which causes depression. Effective treatment for mild to
moderate depression
Problem-solving therapy: Identifying specific problems and taking steps to solve them
Interpersonal psychotherapy: Clarify/resolve interpersonal difficulties
Electroconvulsive therapy
Useful for refractory depression
Works well in the elderly population (especially when antidepressant side-effects
are not tolerated)

CLINICAL PEARLS
Differentiate between depression and bipolar disorder as therapies are different
Easiest way to differentiate between depression and bipolar disorder is to determine if there
is a history of a single hypomanic episode, which rules out unipolar depression. Refer to
DSM-V for criteria
Indefinite antidepressant maintenance therapy may be necessary after a third episode of
major depression
Depressive episodes which occur early in life predict a more severe course
