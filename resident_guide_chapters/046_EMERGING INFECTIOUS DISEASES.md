46. EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
—PART ONE: BACKGROUND—
DEFINITIONS
Emerging infectious disease: Appearance of an infectious disease in a new host,
specifically with rapidly increasing incidence or geographic domain within the last 20
years or expected to increase in the near future
“Re-emerging infectious diseases:” Rapidly increasing incidence of disease caused by
pathogens that previously infected humans or previously at low incidence
“Deliberately emerging disease:” Subcategory referring to bioterrorism in which new
infectious disease is intentionally exposed to a population
Epidemic: Event where a disease spreads rapidly through a community in which that
disease typically has little or no presence
Pandemic: An epidemic that occurs worldwide
Microbial traffic:The transfer of existing pathogens to a new geographic community
HISTORY AND TIMELINE
Infectious diseases have caused a significant mortality burden throughout history, referred
to as “plagues,” “genocides,” or an “apocalypse”
1347: Bubonic plague (Black Death) caused by Yersinia Pestis, endemic to rodents,
estimated 50 million deaths primarily in Europe. Death toll was over one quarter of the
world population
1494: Syphilis spread from Americas to Europe, caused by Treponema pallidum, over
50,000 deaths
1520: Smallpox on the rise, causing about 3.5 million deaths
1832: Spread of cholera across Asia, Europe, and Americas killing over 18,000 people
Late 1800’s: Improvements in poverty levels, quality of housing, education, public
health and sanitation efforts, sewage systems, and chlorination of water. All of which
contributed defense against infection burden
1918: Spanish flu, estimated 50 million deaths
1950’s: Discovery of penicillin and streptomycin dramatically improved mortality
against several bacterial agents
1976: Ebola virus is first detected and since that time caused 29 epidemics and killed over
15,000 people
1979: WHO announced eradication of smallpox
Mid to late 1900’s: Multiple political leaders and organizational powers declare
infectious diseases a thing of the past
1980’s: Discovery of HIV/AIDS as a disease and the pathogenic etiology discovered.
Since that time, it is estimated to have killed over 37 million people
1994: CDC founded the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases
1995: Outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Kikwit, Zaire. A new infection thought to
have been transmitted from monkeys to charcoal burners
1996: United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO) take steps to improve
international response to emerging infectious diseases by emphasizing awareness and
mobilizing resources. The same year, the White House under the chairmanship of Vice
President Al Gore issued a “Fact Sheet: Addressing the Threat of Emerging Infectious
Diseases.”
2000: Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) develops the National Intelligence Estimate
185
ID
(NIE) that outlines possible scenarios as well as likely socioeconomic and political
implications of emerging infectious disease. The same year brought establishment of
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) which focuses on ensuring
adequate resources and access to experts in resource-poor countries in the event of global
infectious emergencies
2002–2003: SARS from novel coronavirus discovered, killed an estimated 813 people but
did not meet criteria for a pandemic
2003: National security elite formed The Rand Corporation who outlined an analysis
of the impact of emerging infectious disease on national security, proposing that military
forces were becoming less of a threat as infectious disease was becoming a growing threat.
2009: H1N1 flu killed 284,000 people
2014: Chikungunya declared pandemic but has low mortality rates
2015: Zika virus meets pandemic levels after having been known for decades. The
pandemic was thought to be triggered by a mutation resulting in increased pathogenicity
2019: SARS-CoV-2 reaches pandemic levels, estimated to cause more than 6 million
deaths by March of 2022
ONGOING THREATS
Despite developments listed above including public sanitation measures, growing
research and understanding of infection pathogenesis, vaccination efforts, and antibiotics,
novel infections continue to affect and devastate communities

—PART TWO: FACTORS IN EMERGENCE—
FEATURES OF PATHOGENS AND PANDEMICS
Must be some change to a pre-existing pathogen. May include genetic mutation/
variation or spread to a new location
Must be capable of infecting human hosts and able to transmit from human to human
Transmission is rapid enough to spread easily within a community or population
High mortality may limit transmission (could kill host before community spread)
Majority of emerging infectious diseases originate from zoonotic and vector-borne
infections that mutate and cross-infect human hosts. New mutations of existing infectious
disease can allow for re-emergence, but this is less common
ORGANISM FACTORS IN EMERGENCE
Genetic variation and mutations. Highest rates of mutation naturally occur in viruses.
Viruses, especially RNA viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses have high genetic
instability due to innate lack of polymerase error detection and correction mechanisms.
This results in hundreds or thousands of genetic variants
Emergence of resistance, especially related to antibiotic use and exposure
HUMAN HOST FACTORS IN EMERGENCE
Growing populations and increase in urban living. Often higher risk for overcrowding
and sanitation limitations that promote environments in which pathogens thrive
186
ID
Increasing immunosuppression related to medications, diseases, cancers, malnutrition,
aging, etc.
Sex and drug traffickingbehaviors, especially in populations that have limited access to
healthcare
Availability of travel and migration
Inadequate immunization
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN EMERGENCE
Hospital and health care associated risk factors such as use of lines/drains/airways,
antibiotic use, and susceptible hosts
Risk of contamination from food processing and handling
Changes in agricultural practices changing exposure to new animals and vectors
carrying pathogens
International food trade with limited ability to screen for transfer of infectious organisms
Reforestation bringing vectors to new populations
Global climate changing the geographic environment of vectors and hosts carrying
diseases

—PART THREE: INFLUENZA—
VIROLOGY
Negative-sense RNA virus in the family Orthomyxoviridae
InfluenzaA infects multiple species including humans, farm animals, birds. Cross-
infection between species allows for antigenic shifts, meaning reassortments of large gene
segments, which are high risk for pandemic. Also experiences mutational drift which is a
smaller amount of genetic change result in evasion of human defense mechanisms
INFECTION
Symptoms: Most often causes fever, chills, sweats, cough, myalgias, malaise that last 2 –
8 days
Severe disease may result from bacterial superinfection, respiratory distress, and
multiorgan failure
High risk patients are those that are more likely to have severe disease due to underlying
risk factors. These include pre-existing chronic disease, age > 65 years, age < 5 years,
institutionalized adults, pregnant women
HISTORY
InfluenzaA 1918 pandemic was caused by an H1N1 avian flu. Started at the end of World
War I with small but significant outbreaks in military camps and crowded workplaces,
notably with high mortality rates in young adults. Spread across the globe in about 5
months. Estimated 20 million deaths worldwide in less than one year, 1 in 4 became sick in
the U.S. alone
No vaccines or antibiotics for superimposed infections
Efforts were limited to quarantine, isolation, personal hygiene, social distancing
An H2N2 strain of influenza peaked in 1957–1958 in East Asia known as “Asian flu."
Deaths reached over one million worldwide
In 1968, an H3N2 strain was discovered in the United States that ultimately resulted in
one million deaths worldwide and persists currently as part of seasonal flu activity
In 2009, new H1N1 strain was identified, thought to be result of quadruple reassortment
across multiple species. Led to millions of infections and estimated 18,500 deaths. This
strain also continues to circulate seasonally
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Yearly seasonal vaccination is recommended for everyone age over 6 months, especially
high-risk patients
Vaccine changes yearly based on predicted prevalent strains
Efficacy varies by year
Treatment: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is preferred agent. Neuraminidase inhibitors
(amantadine) are no longer recommended due to resistance
Indicated for high-risk patients, hospitalized patients, or severe/progressive illness
Consider treatment of close contacts who are high-risk for severe illness
Other patients should consider risk/benefit discussion prior to initiating treatment
Anti-viral medications are most effective within the first 24–36 hours of symptoms

—PART FOUR: CORONAVIRUS—
VIROLOGY
Coronaviridae family, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest known viral genome
Coronaviruses enter cells via acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-2 which is present in a variety
of animal host species
INFECTION
Incubation period is 5–14 days
Symptoms: Fever, fatigue, myalgias, anosmia, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting,
diarrhea that may progress to respiratory distress syndrome or multisystem inflammatory
response
Range of severity: 80% develop mild or asymptomatic infection, 15% require oxygen
support, and 5% require critical care
Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions are higher risk for more severe
disease
Multisystem Inflammatory Response in Children (MIS-C): infectious syndrome that
includes fever and involvement of at least two organ systems as well as laboratory
evidence of inflammatory process. Thought to be post-infectious immune dysregulation
Clinical criteria: Age < 21 years with at least 24 hours of fever and severe illness
requiring hospitalization, two or more organ systems involved
One or more of an elevated CRP, ESR, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin,
LDH, or IL-6; elevated neutrophils or reduced lymphocytes; low albumin
Positive COVID testing or confirmed exposure within 4 weeks prior
Patients should be treated in pediatric intensive care unit. Suspected cases should start
with laboratory testing and referral to pediatric hospital
HISTORY
2002–2003: Outbreak known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China,
thought to have originated in bats
Viral etiology named SARS-CoV
Mortality rates were about 10%, increased in higher risk individuals
A large proportion of infected individuals were health care workers. Risk of
transmission was highest with inadequate use of PPE or aerosol-generating procedures
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first described in 2015, caused by
novel coronavirus
Pathogen was named MERS-CoV and is not well described but thought to have
originated from bats then transferred to camels then humans
Mortality was as high as 36%
December 2019: Viral pneumonia devastating Wuhan, China. Pathogen was isolated and
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
virus in the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)
At the time of writing, the pandemic has resulted in over 20 million infections and
over 350,000 deaths in the United States alone
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Vaccination: Rapid efforts to develop vaccines resulted in availability of immunization
within one year of being in pandemic state. Development included the first ever mRNA-
based vaccines
189
ID
Diagnosis: PCR testing has become the preferred method and has high sensitivity and
specificity for viral detection
Treatment: Currently no curative treatments, primarily based on disease severity starting
with supportive care and progression to pharmaceutical options in specific clinical
scenarios
Supportive care: Antipyretics, analgesics for muscle aches, hydration. Low threshold
for supplemental oxygen and hospitalization in more severe cases
Pharmaceutical indications rapidly evolving, more studies are needed. Strongest
evidence for corticosteroids and Remdesivir in oxygen-dependent hospitalized
patients, neither has shown benefit in patients without hospitalization
Monoclonal antibody treatments under EUA for outpatient therapy and high risk of
disease progression
Other agents have been studies with inconclusive benefits or possible harms include
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, Tamiflu (oseltamivir), and several novel agents

—PART FIVE: VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE—
BACKGROUND
Definition: Infections that are primarily or exclusively transmitted through invertebrates,
most commonly mosquitos and ticks
West Nile virus is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S.
Vector-borne diseases are high risk for becoming emerging public health threats
Vectors have ability to contact large human populations from environmental and
ecosystem alterations such as climate change as well as changes in human behavior
through travel networks and water storage containers that can function as breeding
grounds for mosquitos
Infections are able to spread very efficiently in large groups of naive hosts in the above
situations
Examples of vector-borne disease: West Nile Virus, Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya, Lyme
Disease, Malaria, Rickettsia
WEST NILE VIRUS
History
Outbreaks occurred in the Mediterranean in the 1950’s then continued to spread
through the Middle East and Europe, spread to North America in 1999
Rapid spread in the United States classified as an emerging infectious disease in the
early 2000’s
Transmission: Most commonly transmitted to humans by mosquitos but can be
transmitted via birds. Rarely blood transfusions, organ transplants, exposure in a laboratory
setting, or vertical transmission (including delivery and breastfeeding)
Signs and symptoms
Asymptomatic in 80%
Acute, systemic, febrile illness including headache, weakness, myalgias, GI symptoms
Transient maculopapular rash
Less than 1% of infected patients develop neuro-invasive disease (meningitis,
encephalitis, flaccid paralysis)
Physical exam is relatively non-specific
Laboratory evaluation
Antibody testing: Serum or CSF studies detect specific IgM antibodies, typically 3–8
days after onset of illness and persist for 1–3 months
Viral cultures and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): positive
result can confirm infection but not very sensitive
CSF studies: Typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis but neutrophils may dominate
early in the course of infection
Imaging: MRI usually not very useful as it is often normal. Some signal abnormalities
may be seen in patients with encephalitis
191
ID
Treatment
Clinical management is supportive. No antiviral therapies are approved for WNV
Treatments tried have no shown efficacy though the utility of these studies are limited
by small sample sizes. Trials have included polyclonal IVIG, recombinant monoclonal
antibodies, Interferon, Ribavirin, Corticosteroids
Meningitis: Pain control for headaches and antiemetic therapy for nausea and vomiting
in conjunction with rehydration therapy
Encephalitis: Need close monitoring for development of elevated intracranial pressure
and seizures. Airway protection needs to be monitored; prolonged ventilator support
may be required and respiratory failure can progress quickly
Prevention
No vaccines are available
Prevention is at the community-level. Mosquito control is key. Screening of blood and
organ donors also required at the population level
At the individual level, precautions to prevent mosquito bites should be stressed such
as use of insect repellant, wearing long sleeved shirts and pants, using screens and air
conditioning where available, etc.
ZIKA
History
First isolated in 1947, since that time there have been multiple outbreaks in different
locations throughout the world. Declared a public health emergency in 2016 but
decreased considerably by 2018 (thought to be due to herd immunity)
The CDC website should be checked for the latest geographical distribution as
pregnant women should be counseled on travel to locations where mosquito-borne
transmission of Zika virus has been reported
Transmission
Mosquito bites: Primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species
mosquito. These mosquitos typically lay eggs in standing water and like to inhabit
indoor areas and outdoor areas near people. They become infected by biting a human
that is already infected and then spread the virus to others through subsequent bites
Vertical transmission: Zika virus can be spread from an infected mother to her fetus
during pregnancy
Sexual transmission: Zika virus can spread from person to person during sexual
intercourse. A patient does not need to be symptomatic to spread the virus as spread
can occur before, during, and after symptoms are experienced. It is currently unknown
how long the virus remains as a contagion in bodily fluids but it is known that Zika
remains active in seminal fluids for a longer period of time than vaginal fluids, urine,
or blood
Blood transfusion: No current reported cases in the United States, but there have been
multiple reports of transmission through blood transfusion in Brazil
Nosocomial: There are a few case reports of laboratory acquired Zika virus. Healthcare
providers are encouraged to take Standard Precautions to prevent transmission
Signs and symptoms: Many infected people will show no symptoms or only mild
symptoms lasting 3-4 days
The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, myalgias, and
headache
Older children and adults may progress to neuropathy, myelitis, or Guillain-Barre
syndrome
Vertical transmission to a fetus can result in microcephaly and other severe fetal brain
defects. The syndrome can result in fetal loss or still birth
Laboratory evaluation
Diagnosis is usually based on history (travel to endemic areas) and symptoms
Lab tests have been fast-tracked and approved by the FDA under Emergency Use
Authorization
192
ID
Zika Virus RNA: Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). Testing should be done on serum and urine collected less than 14 days after
symptom onset. A positive result on either sample confirms Zika virus infection and
no additional testing is needed. A negative result does not exclude Zika virus infection
and a follow-up IgM antibody test of the serum should be completed
Trioplex Real-time RT-PCR Assay: Designed to detect Zika virus, dengue virus, and
chikungunya virus RNA
Zika MAC-ELISA: A test for qualitative detection of Zika virus IgM antibodies
in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Generally will test positive starting at day 4 of the
infection and will stay positive through week 12 following the onset of infection.
Results can be difficult to interpret due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses.
Plaque-reduction neutralization testing is performed by CDC for presumptive positive,
equivocal, or inconclusive results
Treatment: Symptomatic with rest, fluids, and acetaminophen for fever. Acetaminophen is
favored over NSAIDs until Dengue is ruled out due to risk of bleeding
Prevention: The main control of infection and sequelae is prevention. Pregnant women are
at highest risk of sequelae and should be counseled to not travel to an area with active Zika
virus transmission. Pregnant women with partners who live in or traveled to an area with
Zika should use a condom to prevent sexual transmission every time they have sex, or not
have sex for the duration of the pregnancy
For all travelers, precautions to prevent mosquito bites should be stressed such as
use of insect repellant, wearing long sleeved shirts and pants, using screens and air
conditioning where available, etc.

—PART SIX: ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP—
BACKGROUND
Antibiotic resistance: Ability of an organism to survive and infect the host despite use of
antibiotics designed to kill them
Occurs as a result of selection of resistant organisms exposed to antibiotics in the
environment including from antibiotics in human hosts, animals, or agriculture
Antibiotic stewardship: Efforts to reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics or reducing
duration and broad spectrum of action to lowest required in order to minimize developing
resistance
CDC 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threat Report estimates over 2.8 million resistant
infections in the United States yearly resulting in over 35,000 deaths
The CDC report categorizes resistant infections into urgent, serious, and concerning
categories based on clinical and economic burden, incidence and projected
transmission, available antibiotics, and barriers to prevention
Antibiotic prescribing contributes to a growing burden of resistant pathogens. Prescribing
from 2000–2010 overall increased and specifically broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing
increased. Majority of antibiotics are prescribed on an outpatient basis
STRATEGIES TO LIMIT ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE
Delayed antibiotic prescription: Consider prescription with instructions for delayed
fill (often 48–72 hours later) if worsening/unresolved symptoms or plan for short-term
reassessment with antibiotic prescription if no resolution
193
ID
Children with acute otitis media given delayed prescriptions do not fill prescription in
62% of cases
Rates of antibiotic use in adults with acute respiratory infections: 91% of patients
given immediate antibiotic prescriptions, 33% of patients given delayed prescriptions,
12% of patients not given prescriptions
Patient education regarding risks (resistance, side-effects, cost) and benefits of antibiotics
use
Recommend treatment options for symptoms and supportive recovery
Common situations that receive unnecessary antibiotics are listed in the Table below:

—PART SEVEN: INFECTION CONTROL—
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS
194
ID
Surveillance: Monitoring and reporting new or unusual clusters of diseases in order to
prevent spread and allow for early intervention
Played an important role in smallpox eradication
There are specific surveillance programs and initiatives for influenza
Sanitation and hygiene: Public access to clean water supplies as well as personal hygiene
and frequent hand washing can prevent spread of several known pathogens
Proper food storage, handling, and preparation can also help prevent spread of organisms
Research: Focusing on improving surveillance, diagnostics, drug treatments, and
immunizations
Governing bodies that outline procedures and govern protocols during or prior to
outbreaks
FACTORS WITHIIN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS
Hospitals and health care environments are high risk for infectious spread
There should be adequate communication with local and state health departments
regarding potential or confirmed outbreak cases
Educate patients regarding signs and symptoms of concern and screen patients prior to
in-person encounters
Make isolation precautions clear, such as signs on the door, with appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) available
Have a designated patient care location for patients with symptoms possibly related to
the infection of concern
Train health care personnel on donning and doffing PPE
Consider limiting providers contact with patients known to have disease or potentially
with disease such as excluding trainees or high-risk providers
Standard precautions should be used in all patient care situations which includes hand
hygiene, cough etiquette, and donning of appropriate PPE if contacting blood or body fluids
INDIVIDUAL PREVENTION/CONTROL
Quarantine: Has been practiced since the Middle Ages. Very effective in controlling
spread but often developed a stigma that resulted in under-reporting of symptoms which is
often counterproductive
Consider the modes of transmission for each particular infection
Contact transmission: Most common route, includes direct and indirect contact
Direct transmission refers to an infectious pathogen from one person transferring to
another person without a mediating object or person (body fluids contacting mucous
membranes or open wounds, mites transferring from body to body, contact with
herpetic wounds)
Indirect transmission occurs through a contaminated object or person (i.e.,
contaminated PPE)
Examples: RSV, VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses, multidrug resistant organisms
Contact precautions: Single-patient room, gown and gloves for providers
Droplet transmission: Infection transferred via respiratory droplets from an infected
individual that contact mucous membranes of another individual
Usually travel only short distances
Generated with coughing, sneezing, talking, or during procedures (intubation, suction,
CPR)
The distance that respiratory droplets can travel is unclear but typically less than 3 feet
with the exception of smallpox and certain coronavirus infections which may travel
up to 6 feet. Distance that droplets travel can be affected by mode of generation and
environmental factors
Examples: Bordetella pertussis, influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), N. meningitides, and group
A streptococcus (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy)
Droplet precautions: Single-patient room, facemask
195
ID
Airborne transmission: Dispersion of small particle aerosols that remain infectious for a
duration of time while suspended in the air
Examples: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster
virus (chickenpox)
Airborne precautions: Airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) which requires
negative pressure ventilation as well as multiple other air quality measures, N95 mask
or respirator
There has been a proposed categorization of airborne transmission to account for
certain infections that may be transferred via airborne transmission in certain family
situations
Obligate: Only transferred via aerosols (TB)
Preferential: multiple modes of transmission but most commonly airborne
(measles, chickenpox)
Opportunistic: Typically transferred via alternate routes but under certain
circumstances could potentially transmit via aerosols
IMMUNIZATION
Vaccination hesitancy: Refusal of or delay in receiving vaccines despite accessibility.
Intervention: Most effective is multi-modal approach, specifically including targeted
outreach, education, improved accessibility, engaging influential groups or individuals
Education is most effective when tailored to specific concerns
Physicians should be aware of adverse effects and contraindications as well as common
myths regarding vaccination
Adverse effects
In general, most common for all vaccines include local pain, erythema, swelling at the
injection site. Sometimes systemic response including fevers, irritability, rash
Syncope may occur after injection and is more common in adolescents
Serious adverse reactions: anaphylaxis to vaccine components, immune
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) related to MMR (occurs in 1 per 20,000 doses),
febrile seizure related to MMR (occurs in 8.5 per 10,000 doses), intussusception
related to rotavirus (occurs in 1 per about 100,000 doses)
Contraindications
All vaccines: Anaphylaxis to a component. Specifically consider allergy to neomycin
(contained in varicella, MMR, and IPV vaccines) or allergy to gelatin (contained in
varicella and MMR vaccines)
Live vaccines (MMR, varicella): Contraindicated for severely immunocompromised
and pregnant patients
Pertussis-containing vaccines: Patients with encephalopathy within 7 days of prior
pertussis-containing vaccine and no other cause
Rotavirus: Severe combined immunodeficiency or history of intussusception
Precautions: Conditions that may increase risk of severe adverse events or limit
effectiveness of vaccination
All vaccines: Moderate or severe acute illness. Not due to safety concerns but more
due to delineating adverse-effects
MMRV: Family or personal history of seizures
Other vaccine facts that may help with counseling
Egg allergy is not a contraindication to receiving vaccination (if anaphylactic reaction,
patients do need to ensure egg-free influenza vaccination)
Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that was removed from vaccines in
1999 by the FDA since cumulative dosing may exceed recommended mercury intake.
The removal was not related to any neurodevelopmental or autism correlation. The
only vaccine that contains thimerosal currently is certain influenza vaccines and the
amount is considered safe by the FDA
The publication reporting MMR vaccination causes autism has been retracted for
fraud. Autism is not one of the adverse effects of MMR vaccination

ID
There is conflicting evidence regarding Guillain-Barre syndrome related to influenza
vaccination. Current reports suggest an incidence of 1 per 1 million doses may
experience GBS. Association of Guillain-Barre after influenza infection is higher,
suggesting that vaccination is likely to decrease overall incidence
Response to vaccine refusal: The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends
directing parents to credible source of information. If continued refusal, it is recommended
to have parents sign a “refusal to vaccinate form” which can be found on the American
Academy of Pediatrics website
Credible immunization resources: American Academy of Pediatrics website, CDC
website, Every Child By Two Initiative, Immunization Action Coalition
Consequences of failure to vaccinate includes an increased risk of infection, both in
children who do and do not receive vaccination
In 2014 there was an outbreak of over 600 cases of measles mainly in an unvaccinated
community
In 2012 there was an outbreak of pertussis effecting over 40,000 children and resulted
in 20 deaths. There may have been a combination of under-vaccination as well as
waning immunity
Response to adverse reactions: Providers should report adverse events to the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System which helps to monitor safety of vaccinations. The
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is available to assist patients who do
experience injury from recommended vaccines
