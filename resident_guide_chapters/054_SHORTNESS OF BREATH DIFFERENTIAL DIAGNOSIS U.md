54. SHORTNESS OF BREATH
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Upper airway causes
Tracheal obstruction (cancer, foreign body, mucous plug)
Infection (epiglottitis, croup)
Angioedema/anaphylaxis
Retropharyngeal abscess
Pulmonary causes
Obstructive lung disease (COPD, asthma)
Infection (pneumonia, bronchitis, tuberculosis)
Pneumothorax
Pulmonary embolism, fat/air/amnionic fluid embolism
Pleural effusion
Lung masses, metastatic disease
Restrictive lung diseases
Extrathoracic: Chest wall restriction (kyphoscoliosis, obesity, ascites),
diaphragmatic dysfunction, abdominal distention, pregnancy
Intrathoracic: Infiltrate, infiltrative process (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, pulmonary
fibrosis), pneumonectomy, parenchymal process
Pulmonary hypertension
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Carbon monoxide toxicity
Cystic fibrosis
Cardiac causes
Congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema)
Acute MI/anginal equivalent/myocardial ischemia
Cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia)
Cardiac valvular disease
Pericarditis/pericardial tamponade/myocarditis
Hypertensive crisis
Systemic causes
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema: Drug overdose, pancreatitis, trauma, sepsis,
inhalation of toxic chemicals
Anemia
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)/metabolic acidosis
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)
Hyper-/hypothyroidism
Deconditioning
Carbon monoxide poisoning, methemoglobinemia
Central causes
Panic disorder/anxiety
Acute hyperventilation
Cheyne-Stokes (rapid breathing): Seen in coma from intracerebral pathology
Central nervous system and systemic neuromuscular disorders such as CVA, phrenic
nerve paralysis, Guillain Barre, tick paralysis, botulism
Multiple sclerosis
Phrenic nerve dysfunction
Sleep apnea

HISTORY
History of present illness
General: Fever, night sweats, or weight loss
ENT: Sore throat, dysphonia, dysphagia, acuity of onset, drooling/inability to handle
secretions, recent pharyngitis
Respiratory
Dyspnea: Acuity of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating and relieving
factors, relation to exertion or environmental exposure, relation to chest
discomfort, associated orthopnea/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Cough: Productive vs. dry, duration, exacerbating factors, and time of day
Hemoptysis
Cardiac: Chest discomfort, heart racing, or palpitations
Extremities: Peripheral edema
Other: Work and travel exposures, anxiety/depression
Past medical/surgical history
Previous diagnoses of shortness of breath, cardiac or pulmonary disease, CAD risk
factors, history of diabetes, history of previous DVT/PE, prolonged immobility, or oral
contraceptive use
Recent infections
Medications
Smoking history
Home oxygen use
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs: Fever, tachypnea, tachycardia/bradycardia, hypotension, oxygen saturation
HEENT: Assess (JVD), tracheal deviation, periorbital cyanosis, glossal deviation,
peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, any other upper airway obstructions
Chest: Rales/crackles, rhonchi, increased A-P chest wall diameter (COPD), dullness to
percussion/decreased breath sounds, wheezing (asthma, pulmonary edema, foreign body),
stridor, palpable crepitus
Cardiac: Gallop, murmur, rub, distant heart sounds (pericardial tamponade), loud P2
(pulmonary hypertension)
Extremities: Clubbing, cyanosis, edema, unilateral edematous or tender leg (DVT)
TESTS
Radiology: PA and lateral chest x-rays (CXR)
Pleural effusions are best seen at the costophrenic angle on the lateral film
Pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis as CXR findings of pneumonia may lag behind
clinical findings
Assess for pneumothorax, heart size, rib fracture, mediastinal widening/deviation, or
free air under the diaphragm
Lateral neck films should be considered to evaluate for upper airway compromise
ABG: Assess pH, pO2, pCO2
EKG: Should be performed in any patient > 30 and all patients with a history of CAD
or diabetes with undiagnosed dyspnea. In addition to signs of ischemia/infarction, and
arrhythmias, look for signs of pericarditis, pericardial effusion/tamponade, pulmonary
embolism, and COPD
Pulse oximetry: Measures oxygenation only. Rest and exercise oximetry may reveal
oxygen desaturation (early finding in interstitial lung disease and pulmonary HTN,
pneumocystis pneumonia). The pulse oximetry may be limited by nail polish, hypothermia,
severe vasoconstriction, carboxyhemoglobins, or methemoglobinemias, shock
Pulmonary function testing: Evaluate for following
Evaluation of pulmonary dysfunction: Obstructive vs. restrictive impairment
Evaluation of dyspnea and cough
Evaluation of response to therapy
To determine if there is bronchial reactivity: Methacholine challenge
231
GEN
To determine if there is a reversible component to obstructive lung disease
Preoperative evaluation in selected patients
Evaluation of upper airway obstruction with a flow-volume loop
Chest CT: Used primarily as a follow-up of abnormal CXR
Ventilation-perfusion scan/helical CT/pulmonary angiography: See Section V
regarding evaluation for PE
Laboratory testing
Based on history and physical exam
CBC (elevated WBC, anemia, etc.), electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, glucose
Thyroid function tests
α-1 antitrypsin
Bronchoscopy indications
Evaluation of hemoptysis
Diagnosis and staging of bronchogenic carcinoma, biopsy of tracheal or 2nd–4th
generation bronchial tumors
Diagnosis of lung infiltrates and certain pulmonary infections including PCP and TB
Removal of foreign bodies
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing: Perform if clinical presentation suggests cardiac
etiology, or if work-up is negative
EVALUATION FOR PULMONARY EMBOLUS
Estimated 650,000 cases/year in the U.S.
DVT is the etiology in 80–90% of cases
The classic triad of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain occurs in < 20% of
patients
EKG: Sinus tachycardia is the most common finding, plus new RBBB, p-pulmonale,
S1Q3T3 (rarely), and 40% have non-specific ST-T wave changes
CXR: Usually normal or with nonspecific findings. May have infiltrate or atelectasis in
50%. Beware of a normal CXR in the setting of dyspnea and hypoxia. Hampton’s hump
(a wedge shaped pleural based infiltrate) and Westermark sign (relative oligemia distal to
engorged pulmonary arteries with massive PE) are uncommon
ABG: PaO2 may be normal but is often decreased, may see hypocapnia or increased A-a
gradient. Not helpful in outpatient setting
Laboratory: D-Dimer should be used in conjunction with the estimated pretest prob-
ability of PE. Best reserved for ED setting
ELISA test has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 30–40% and can be used to
exclude PE (especially in a low-risk patient)
CT pulmonary angiography: Gold standard test for diagnosis of PE. Will also screen for
other pulmonary etiologies of symptoms
Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan: Reserved for patients for whom CT pulmonary
angiography is contraindicated (allergy to contrast, increased risk of contrast-induced
nephropathy). False positives are increased in patients who have an infiltrate on CXR,
preexisting cardiopulmonary disease, and history of previous PE. Will give 1 of 4 different
categories including
Normal: No perfusion defects
Low probability: < 20% chance of PE
Intermediate probability: 20–80% chance of PE
High probability: > 80% chance of PE
CLINICAL PEARLS
Tachypnea is the most common sign of pneumonia in the elderly
Virchow’s triad includes venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial damage and are
factors contributing to the development of DVT
In immunocompromised patients, dyspnea is often the initial manifestation of
Pneumocystis pneumonia
232
GEN
Steroids should be given early to asthmatics to minimize their chances of hospital
admission
Sinus tachycardia is the most common EKG finding with a pulmonary embolism
Retropharyngeal abscess and epiglottitis are emergency situations requiring immediate
pharyngeal examination by ENT specialists
Patients with alcoholism and seizure disorders are at risk for aspiration
A normal pulse oximetry does not exclude the possibility of pulmonary emboli
