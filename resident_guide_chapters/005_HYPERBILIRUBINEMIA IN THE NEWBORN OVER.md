5. HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA IN THE NEWBORN OVER
35 WEEKS GESTATION
INTRODUCTION
Jaundice occurs in most newborns and is usually benign
Untreated severe hyperbilirubinemia can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy
(preferred term, previously known as kernicterus)
This chapter will focus on newborn infants born at 35 weeks gestation or after and reflects
recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
4 main principles
Promote breastfeeding
Assess newborns before hospital discharge for risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia
Provide early follow-up based on risk assessment
Treat newborns with phototherapy or exchange transfusion when indicat
MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA
Total serum bilirubin (TSB) level above 8mg/dL at 24 hours or 13mg/dL at 48 hours
Observed jaundice in first 24 hours
Blood group incompatibility with positive direct antiglobulin test
Gestational age less than 36 weeks
Sibling who needed phototherapy or exchange transfusion
Cephalohematoma or significant bruising
Exclusive breastfeeding
Minor risk factors
TSB level above 6mg/dL at 24 hours or 8.5mg/dL at 48 hours
Gestational age 37–38 weeks
Jaundice seen before hospital discharge
Sibling with jaundice
Macrosomic infant of diabetic mother
Maternal age over 25 years
Male gender
ASSESSMENT FOR JAUNDICE
In well lighted room, blanch the skin with digital pressure to see the color of the
underlying skin and tissue. Skin should appear jaundiced with bilirubin levels > 4mg/dL
Dermal icterus progresses in a cephalocaudad direction. Jaundice which is not evident
below the nipple line is very unlikely to be above 12mg/dL. Jaundice which is below the
nipple line may be above or below 12mg/dL
Hyperbilirubinemia may be measured with transcutaneous bilirubinometry (TCB) or total
serum bilirubin (TSB)
TSB is useful for initial screening but becomes less accurate at higher levels of
bilirubin (generally > 15mg/dL)
Once phototherapy is initiated, therapy should be guided by TSB
May need to collect blood typing and direct Coombs’ test to assess for hyperbilirubinemia
and neurotoxicity risk level
ACTION PLAN FOR PHOTOTHERAPY (Note: Risk for neurotoxicity: Isoimmune
hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy, temperature instability,

sepsis, acidosis, albumin < 3g/dL)
At 24–48 hours
If infant is high risk (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is
over 8–11
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 10–13
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 12–15
At 48–96 hours
If infant is (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is over
11–14.5
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 13–17
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 15–20
Over 96 hours to 7 days
If infant is high risk (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is
over 11–14.5
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 13–17
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 15–20
ACTION PLAN FOR EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION
Absolute indications include signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy including hypertonia,
arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, fever, high pitched cry—OR—
At 24–48 hours
If infant is high risk (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is
over 15–17
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 16–19
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 19–22
At 48–96 hours
If infant is high risk (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is
over 17–19 consider phototherapy
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 19–22
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 22–25
Over 96 hours to 7 days
If infant is high risk (35–37 weeks plus risk factors) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) is
over 19 consider phototherapy
If infant is medium risk (over 38 weeks plus risk factors or 35–37 weeks and well)
consider phototherapy if TSB over 22
If infant is lower risk (gestation age over 38 weeks and well) consider phototherapy if
TSB above 25
Note: Risk factors: Isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant
lethargy, temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis, albumin < 3g/dL
Note: If infants exceed these levels, this constitutes a medical emergency and patient should
be directly admitted to pediatric service and not go to the emergency department (delays
initiation of treatment)
PHOTOTHERAPY
Irradiance in blue-green spectrum at wavelengths 430–490nm
Other labs, including repeat TSB levels, blood type, antibody test (direct Coombs’),
17
PEDS
G6PD, CBC, reticulocyte count, serum albumin, others per protocol
CLINICAL PEARLS
Jaundice is usually a benign, self-limited condition that can be managed with close obser-
vation and reassurance
Levels of bilirubin considered safe in healthy full-term infants may be pathologic in the
sick or premature infant
Sunlight was previously recommended to lower bilirubin, but practical difficulties with
exposing a naked newborn to sun while avoiding sunburn preclude its use. Sunlight is not
recommended for elevated bilirubin levels
Excessive fluid administration does not affect TSB levels
Continue breastfeeding if infant requires phototherapy
Can consider use of home phototherapy (bilirubin blankets) in cases of borderline
hyperbilirubinemia with close outpatient follow-up
