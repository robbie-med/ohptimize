77. MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY IN ADULTS
PREVALENCE OF OBESITY (CDC STATISTICS)
More than one-third (36.5%) of U.S. adults are obese
Obesity is higher among middle-aged adults aged 40–59 years and older adults aged ≥
60 years than among younger adults (20–39 years)
Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest rates of obesity (48%), followed by Hispanics
(42.5%), non-Hispanic whites (34.5%), and non-Hispanic Asians (11.7%)
People with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have obesity
IMPLICATIONS OF OBESITY
Obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and
various types of cancer. These obesity-related conditions are some of the leading causes of
preventable death among adults
Overweight and obesity, and associated health problems, accounted for a total of
approximately $260 billion in direct and indirect medical cost in the U.S. in 2016
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF OBESITY
The USPSTF recommends that all adults be screened for obesity
Body mass index (BMI) should be used to confirm an excessive degree of adiposity and to
classify individuals as having
Overweight (BMI 25–29.9kg/m2)
Obesity (BMI ≥30kg/m2)
Waist circumference
Abdominal adiposity is an important independent risk factor for CVD, type 2
diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Compared to individuals with normal waist
circumference, individuals with larger waist circumferences have > than 5 × greater
cardiometabolic risk factors, even after adjusting for BMI
NHLBI defines abdominal obesity as
Waist circumference > 40 in (102cm) in men
Waist circumference > 35 in (88cm) in women
Clinical component
Overweight or obese patients should be evaluated for weight-related complications,
including prediabetes, diabetes risk, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension,
and CVD
Patients with comorbid conditions should be evaluated for overweight or obesity

TREATMENT GOAL FOR OBESITY
The principal treatment goal in obesity is to improve the health of the patient by
preventing or treating weight-related complications using weight loss
The initial goal of weight loss therapy is to reduce 10% of body weight over 6 months.
The rate of weight loss should be 1 to 2lbs each week
After the first 6 months of weight loss therapy, the priority should be weight
maintenance
In some patients, weight loss is not achievable. The goal for these patients should be the
prevention of further weight gain

With comorbidities
Prevention of weight gain with lifestyle therapy is indicated in any patient with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2,
even without comorbidities, while weight loss is not necessarily recommended for those with a
BMI of 25–29.9kg/m2 or a high waist circumference, unless they have two or more comorbidities
Combined therapy with a low-calorie diet (LCD), increased physical activity, and behavior
therapy provide the most successful intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance
Consider pharmacotherapy only if a patient has not lost 1lb per week after 6 months of combined
lifestyle therapy
The + represents the use of indicated treatment regardless of comorbidities.

LIFESTYLE THERAPY
Dietary modification, increased physical activity, and behavior modification should be the
first-line treatment for all patients with obesity
Dietary modification
351
GEN
Reduce caloric intake by 500–750kcal/day from the current level
A low-calorie diet of 1,200–1500kcal/day may be appropriate for women and
1500–1800kcal/day for men
Individualize meal plan based on personal and cultural preferences
Meal plans can include Mediterranean, DASH, low-carb, low-fat, volumetric, high
protein, and vegetarian
Meal replacement diets make it easier for patients to limit calories
Physical activity
Aerobic exercise: Progressively increase the volume and intensity of exercise with
the ultimate goal of ≥150 minutes/week of exercise performed during 3–5 daily
sessions per week
Resistance training: Helps to promote fat loss while preserving fat-free mass. The
goal is to have resistance training 2 to 3 ×/week consisting of single-set exercises
that use the major muscle groups
An increase in non-exercise and active leisure activity should be encouraged to
reduce sedentary behavior
Individualize physical activity according to the capabilities and preferences of the
patient, taking into the account health-related and physical limitations
Involvement of an exercise physiologist or certified fitness professional may be
needed to individualize the physical activity regimen and improve outcomes
Behavior interventions
Behavior therapy provides patients with techniques for adopting dietary and
activity recommendations
Behavioral interventions include self-monitoring of weight, food intake, and
physical activity, goal-setting, education, problem-setting, stimulus control, and
stress reduction
For high-intensity behavioral counseling, consider referring patients to community
interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program in YMCAs or commercial
weight loss programs that utilize a multidisciplinary team and have documented
efficacy
PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR ADULTS
Indication
As an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased activity for long-term weight
management
Considered in adults who have a BMI ≥30 or a BMI of 27–29 with at least 1 weight-
related coexisting condition (such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia)
Use a patient-centered approach when selecting a weight-loss drug. Consider
contraindications, drug-drug interactions, and undesirable adverse effects that could be
problematic for the patient. Choose a medication that can improve the patient’s other
symptoms or conditions

BARIATRIC SURGERY
Types of bariatric surgery currently performed in the U.S.
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding
This is a reversible, least invasive and safest procedure
An inflatable silicone band is placed around the gastric fundus to create a small
(approx. 30mL) pouch
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
The procedure restricts food intake by creating in the upper gastric fundus a small
(< 50 mL) pouch anastomosed to a Roux limb of jejunum. Food bypasses 95% of
the stomach and duodenum and most of the jejunum
Vertical-sleeve gastrectomy
The surgery removes approximately 70% of the stomach, with subsequent
acceleration of gastric emptying
A Cochrane review comparing bariatric procedures found all to be more effective in
promoting weight loss than nonsurgical methods. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical
sleeve gastrectomy were more effective than laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding
Sustained changes in diet and exercise habits are essential following bariatric surgery
Limitations of surgery
High costs initially and at 1 year
Risks of short- and long-term complications
Weight regain in approximately 5–20% of patients
