58. HYPERLIPIDEMIA
SIGNIFICANCE
A major modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is the leading cause of
death for both women and men in the U.S.
An approximation of efficacyof therapy is a 1% reduction in risk of coronary artery
disease (CAD) for every 1% decrease in LDL
ETIOLOGY
Total cholesterol is influenced by genetic predisposition, concomitant disease, certain
medications, and lifestyle
Genetic connection: Autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia—present in 1 in
500 patients with myocardial infarction
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY 2018 GUIDELINE ON THE
MANAGEMENT OF BLOOD CHOLESTEROL
General concepts (See chart on following page for an algorithmic approach to initiation
of therapy)
There is a consistent reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
events from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins)
therapy in secondary and primary prevention populations, with the exception of no
ASCVD event reduction in those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-
IV heart failure or receiving maintenance hemodialysis
A heart healthy diet, regular exercise, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance
of a healthy weight are the foundations of ASCVD risk reduction
The panel was not able to find a reduction in ASCVD outcomes by titrating cholesterol
lowering therapy
The panel was not able to find a reduction in ASCVD outcomes by the use of Niacin to
additionally lower non-HDL cholesterol once an LDL target was achieved
Note: This new approach abandons the previous approach of “treat-to-goal.” The
panel recommends using current RCT evidence to reduce ASCVD events by using the
maximum tolerated statin therapy for those groups shown to benefit (See below)
Groups that benefit from statin therapy (4 main groups where the benefit outweighs
the risk)
Individuals with clinical ASCVD (acute coronary syndromes (ACS), history
of myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary or arterial
revascularization, stroke, TIA or peripheral arterial disease from ASCVD)
Primary elevations of LDL–C > 190mg/dL
Diabetic aged 40 to 75 years with LDL–C 70 to 189mg/dL and without clinical
ASCVD
Individuals without clinical ASCVD or diabetes with LDL–C 70 to 189mg/dL and
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5%. See risk calculator at: https://tools.acc.org/

Recommendations based on risk group
Note: This new approach abandons the previous approach of “treat-to-goal.” The
panel recommends using current RCT evidence to reduce ASCVD events by using the
maximum tolerated statin therapy for those groups shown to benefit (See below)
Individuals with clinical ASCVD
High-intensity statin therapy if < 75 years of age
If over 75, evaluate potential for benefit vs. risk of side-effects or drug-drug
interactions
Primary elevations of LDL–C > 190mg/dL
Evaluate for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia
Diet
Drugs elevated LDL-C: Diuretics, cyclosporine, glucocorticoids, amiodarone,
Drugs elevated: TG: Oral estrogens, glucocorticoids, bile acid sequestrants,
protease inhibitors, retinoic acid, anabolic steroids, sirolimus, raloxifene,
tamoxifen, β-blockers (not carvedilol), thiazides
248
GEN
Diseases elevated LDL-C: Biliary obstruction, nephrotic syndrome; diseases
elevated TG: nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, lipodystrophies
Disorders of metabolism: elevated LCL-C: Hypothyroidism, obesity, preg-
nancy; elevated TG: diabetes (poorly controlled), hypothyroidism, obesity,
pregnancy
High-intensity statin therapy
Diabetics aged 40 to 75 years with LDL–C 70 to189mg/dL and without clinical
ASCVD
Moderate dose statin therapy
High dose statin therapy if ASCVD risk is > 7.5%
Individuals without clinical ASCVD or diabetes with LDL–C 70 to 189mg/dL and
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5%. Use moderate to high dose statin therapy

Monitoring response to statin therapy
To determine adherence to therapy, obtain a second lipid panel (total cholesterol,
triglycerides, HDL and LDL ) 4–12 weeks after initiation of statin therapy. Thereafter
every 3–12 months as clinically indicated.
NON-STATIN THERAPY
Several early trials with non-statin cholesterol lowering drugs for primary prevention
showed a concerning trend towards increased mortality from non-cardiac causes. Further
well-designed studies are needed before recommendations for a particular non-statin
therapy can be made
PCSK9 Inhibitors: Evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent)
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 inhibition is a novel approach to lipid
lowering. These medications have not as yet been evaluated for primary prevention.
Their high cost, route of delivery (injection therapy), and lack of studies limit their
usefulness to high-risk patients who are unable to tolerate statins
