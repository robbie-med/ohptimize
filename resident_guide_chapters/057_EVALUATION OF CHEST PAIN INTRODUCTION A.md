57. EVALUATION OF CHEST PAIN
INTRODUCTION
A common, but potentially life-threatening symptom that may first present in an
ambulatory setting
Tables and charts listed below will help to stratify patients into high or low risk groups,
and then the decision on how to further evaluate these patients can be made according
to the pre-test likelihood of cardiac or other etiology. See Chapter 60, Coronary Artery
Disease and Chapter 48, Cardiac Stress Testing for more specific information on evaluation
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHEST PAIN
Cardiovascular: Ischemic, valvular disorder, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic
dissection, hypertensive crisis, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure
Pulmonary: Pulmonary embolus (PE), pneumothorax/tension pneumothorax, pneumonia,
asthma, pleurisy, sarcoidosis, acute chest syndrome (sickle cell disease)
Gastrointestinal
Esophageal: Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), esophageal reflux or spasm,
esophageal foreign body, esophagitis (chronic reflux, Barrett’s esophagus, candida,
etc.)
Peptic ulcer disease/gastritis
Mallory-Weiss tear
Pancreatitis
Cholecystitis/symptomatic cholelithiasis
Hepatitis
Musculoskeletal: Costochondritis/musculoskeletal chest wall strain, thoracic outlet syn-
drome, cervical disk disease
Psychogenic: Anxiety/panic disorder, depression
Other: Substance-induced (most commonly cocaine intoxication), herpes zoster, breast
disease, post-nasal drip
HISTORY
Character/radiation of discomfort (Ask about “chest discomfort” instead of “chest
pain”)
Dull pressure, squeezing, burning: Consider CAD or esophageal pain (GERD)
Radiation of pain to neck/shoulder/jaw: Consider CAD
Radiation of pain to the back: Consider aortic dissection, pancreatitis, or perforated
peptic ulcer
Radiation to the epigastrium: Consider GI etiology, pancreatitis, inferior wall MI, AAA
Sharp, stabbing pain: Consider muscular chest wall pain/costochondritis, pleurisy,
pericardial pain, or PE
Onset
Sudden onset: Consider PE, pneumothorax, or aortic dissection
Slow onset (building over 2–5 minutes): Consider CAD
Activity at onset: Exertion, lifting/moving the body, arguing, eating, coughing
Exacerbation/Relief
Exacerbated by exercise or stress and relieved by rest: Consider CAD

GEN
Relieved by Nitroglycerin: Consider CAD or esophageal spasm
Exacerbated by movement of body (positional) or deep inspiration: Consider
musculoskeletal, pericardial, pleuritic disease, or PE
Worse when supine and better with upright position: Consider pericarditis
Other symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia/infarction: See Tables below
Dyspnea
Diaphoresis
Palpitations
Light-headedness
Nausea/vomiting
Radiation to neck, arm, or jaw
Syncope
CHF-related symptoms: Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), peripheral/
dependent edema
Past medical history
Determine risk factors for CAD: Known coronary artery disease or vascular disease,
family history, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, males over 45 years-
old, females over 55 years-old, obesity, sedentary lifestyle
Complete past history including childhood illnesses (rheumatic fever)
Obtain results of stress tests, cardiac catheterizations, ECHOs, PTCA/STENT, and
CABG
Current medications including nitrates, anti-hypertensives, β-blockers, and aspirin
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs: Check heart rate and BP, consider BP in both arms and legs (to evaluate for
coarctation, dissection, AAA)
Neck: Assess for midline trachea, JVD, carotid bruits
Lungs: Listen for bilateral and equal breath sounds, rales, wheezes
Chest: Palpate for subcutaneous air or tenderness
Heart
Inspect (for presence of surgical scars)
Palpate for parasternal lift, increased LV impulse, point of maximal impulse
Auscultate for friction rub, gallops, murmurs, clicks (MVP), distant heart sounds
Abdomen: Pulsatile abdominal mass, bruits
Extremities: Assess for unilateral leg swelling (DVT), cyanosis, clubbing, or edema;
palpate femoral pulses (dissection)

FIVE LIFE THREATENING CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
WORKFLOW FOR CHEST PAIN EVALUATION
If patient is clinically unstable, has highly suspicious CV history with EKG changes, or
concern for life-threatening etiology, need to transfer to ED emergently
Initial work-up must include detailed cardiac history, examination of CV risk factors, and
resting EKG (if possible). If history of suspicious for cardiac disease or there are new EKG
changes (most notably ST-T changes or new LBBB), need to transfer to ED emergently.
Should administer 325mg aspirin, also consider nitroglycerin and/or morphine
If history does not suggest ACS and there are no EKG changes, but suspicion for cardiac
etiology remains e.g., stable, angina), consider stress testing
If history points towards a non-ACS etiology, pursue further work-up as dictated by
clinical suspicion. See Chapter 60 Coronary Artery Disease and Chapter 48 Cardiac Stress
Testing
EKG: Important for diagnosing myocardial ischemia or infarction as well as pericardial
disease. May rarely show findings consistent with PE (S1 Q3T3, though sinus tachycardia
most common finding). See Table below, also Chapter 47, EKG Interpretation
Chest x-ray: Can aid in diagnosing pneumothorax, assessing cardiac silhouette, and
determining a widened mediastinum vs. non cardiac etiologies such as infiltrate, effusion,
or rib fracture
Laboratory: Initial ED work-up may include cardiac enzymes (high sensitivity troponin),
CBC, chemistry, oxygen saturation, and possibly arterial blood gas
Echocardiography: Looking for segmental wall motion abnormalities, pericardial
effusion, root size, aortic insufficiency, mitral regurgitation or papillary muscle dysfunction
CLINICAL PEARLS
Detailed symptom history, pertinent physical exam, and EKG are the most important way
to differentiate ACS from non-cardiac etiologies of chest pain

GEN
Ensure EKG is obtained in a timely fashion if high concern for cardiac etiology, prepare
for transfer based on clinical suspicion. Administer 325mg aspirin while waiting for EMS
to arrive
