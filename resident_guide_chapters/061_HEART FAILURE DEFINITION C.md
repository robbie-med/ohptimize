61. HEART FAILURE
DEFINITION
Complex clinical syndrome of myocardium dysfunction of the myocardium resulting
from decreased cardiac output. Presents with dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of fluid overload.
The dysfunction classified by degree of systolic dysfunction (American Heart Association)
Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF): EF less than 40%
Also known as systolic heart failure, congestive heart failure
Dilated, eccentrically hypertrophied ventricle
Heart failure with borderline EF: EF 41–50%
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): EF greater than 50%
Also known as diastolic heart failure
Thick-walled, concentrically hypertrophied ventricle with normal or small cavity
Disease progression in systolic dysfunction may be slowed or reversed by appropriate
management. Survival is only 57% at 5 years
ETIOLOGY: Disease progression can often be slowed with treatment of reversible causes
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (secondary to CAD)
Hypertensive cardiomyopathy
Valvular dysfunction
Toxic cardiomyopathy (alcohol, cocaine, radiation)
Endocrine: DM, thyroid disease, pheochromocytoma
Myocarditis, pericarditis
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Postpartum cardiomyopathy
Drug induced: Chemotherapy drugs, cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitors, glitazones,
glucocorticoids, androgens, estrogens
Hypo-/hyperthyroid
Renal: Renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis
Pulmonary: Pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolism
Arrhythmia (e.g., heart block, tachycardia, bradycardia)
Collagen vascular disease (SLE, scleroderma)
Other: Infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis), TB, hereditary,
congenital/ASD, VSD
HISTORY
Symptoms of pulmonary edema: Dyspnea with or without exertion, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), chronic non-productive cough (may be worse when
supine)
Fatigue, weight gain, nausea, anorexia, nocturia, peripheral/dependent edema, RUQ
abdominal pain/abdominal swelling (hepatic congestion with right heart failure)
Diet including salt intake, any changes in diet
Exercise intolerance
History of, or symptoms of, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, thyroid
disease
Alcohol
Adherence to medications prescribed for the heart failure
Use of medications which may cause heart failure
263
GEN
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vitals: Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension
Neck: Jugular venous distention, assessment of thyroid gland
Pulmonary: Rales (may be difficult to hear in patients with COPD because of decreased
lung parenchyma), decreased breath sounds secondary to pleural effusions, wheeze,
labored breathing
CV: Murmurs, gallop rhythm, parasternal lift (RVH secondary to pulmonary HTN),
displaced left ventricular impulse (LV dilation/hypertrophy), distended jugular veins,
dependent pitting edema (pretibial, sacral), hepatojugular reflux
Other: Hepatic congestion, diaphoresis
LABORATORY AND OTHER TESTING
Labs
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-BNP: Hormone produced by the cardiac
ventricle when it is exposed to increased wall stress such as due to volume overload
A BNP level < 100pg/mL or pro-BNP < 300pg/mL can reliably rule out acute heart
failure
Levels increase with age and can be elevated in patients with renal failure
Cannot be used to differentiate systolic from diastolic failure
Serum electrolytes (check, magnesium, calcium, potassium if on diuretics)
Complete blood count (anemia)
Renal function and urinalysis (renal causes)
Liver function (hepatic congestion, volume overload)
Consider thyroid function testing if etiology is not known
Digoxin level (if relevant)
Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly, “fluffy” peri-hilar infiltrates (pulmonary edema), pleural
effusion (bilateral or right sided), pulmonary venous congestion; can also identify
pulmonary causes of dyspnea (PNA, pneumothorax, mass)
EKG: Check for evidence of old MI, arrhythmia, bundle branch block (BBB), left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial enlargement (LAE), right atrial enlargement
(RAE)
ECHO: Suggested for patients with a new diagnosis of CHF to differentiate systolic
from diastolic dysfunction, evaluate valvular function, and to check for pulmonary hyper-
tension. ECHO will reveal wall motion abnormalities, old MI, ventricular and atrial
hypertrophy or dilation, valvular dysfunction, shunts and pericardial effusion
Cardiac catheterization: For patients presenting in heart failure with ischemia or angina,
or none of the above but suspected to have coronary artery disease, unless the patient is not
eligible for revascularization
NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION (NYHA) CLASSIFICATION OF CARDIAC
LIMITATION
Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue
fatigue, dyspnea, or anginal pain
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity results in symptoms
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary
activity causes symptoms
Class IV: Unable to engage in any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be
present even at rest
MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED EJECTION
FRACTION (HFrEF)
(Note: See VIII for management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction)
264
GEN
Stage C HFrEF: evidence-based, guideline-directed medical therapy. ACEI indicates angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin-receptor blocker; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction; Hydral-Nitrates, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate; LOE, Level of Evidence; and
NYHA, New York Heart Association.

A. Correct reversible causes: Although CHF might not improve with correction, progression
can often be slowed (CAD, EtOH, HTN, hemochromatosis, etc.)
B. Diet: For patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fluid
retention, restrict sodium and fluid intake and monitor daily weights
C. Activity should include a regular exercise program such as walking 20–30 minutes a day
4–5 times per week as tolerated
D. Medications for HFrEF
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)
First line drugs that should be used in all patients with HFrEF to prevent symp-
tomatic HF and reduce mortality (20%). (Level of evidence A)
Mechanism: Inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the
rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This leads to decrease in vasoconstriction
(normally mediated by angiotensin II) and decrease in sodium retention (normally
mediated by aldosterone)
Start with a low dose and titrate up the dose especially in patients with low blood
pressure, hypovolemia, prerenal azotemia and hyponatremia
265
GEN
Commonly used ACEIs:
Captopril (Capoten): Start 6.25mg TID, max 50mg TID
Enalapril (Vasotec): Start 2.5mg BID, max 10–20mg BID
Fosinopril (Monopril): Start 5–10mg daily, max 40mg daily
Lisinopril (Prinivil): 2.5–5mg daily, max 20–40mg daily
Quinapril (Accupril): 5mg BID, max 20mg BID
Ramipril (Altace): 1.25–2.5 mg daily, max 10mg daily
Trandolapril (Mavik): Start 1mg daily, max 4mg daily
Adverse effects
Cough (5–20%, women > men; blacks, Asians > whites): If the patient is not
able to tolerate the cough, may switch to an ARB
Hypotension (diuretic use or volume depletion)
Hyperkalemia (esp. when also taking K+ sparing or K+ suppl): Monitor K+
Renal failure: Monitor SCr & K+ at baseline and after 1 week
Rash
Angioedema (0.1–0.2%)
Loss of taste
Fetal malformations in 2nd and 3rd trimesters
Drug interactions: NSAIDs, K+
Bilateral renal artery stenosis
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
Use as alternative to ACEI when ACEI is contraindicated or in patients who are
ACEI intolerant. ARBs are not more efficacious than ACEIs and should not be
added to a regimen which includes an ACEI (LOE A)
Mechanism: Inhibits the formation of angiotensin II
Commonly used ARBs:
Candesartan (Atacand): Start 4–8mg daily, max 32mg daily
Losartan (Cozaar): 25–50mg daily, max 50–150mg daily
Valsartan (Diovan): Start 20–40mg BID, max 160mg BID
Side-effects: Same as ACEIs except low risk for cough
ß-blockers
Recommended for all stable patients in all classes of heart failure (LOE A)
Three proven to reduce risk of death: Bisoprolol, Carvedilol, and sustained release
Metoprolol Succinate
Bisoprolol (Ziac): Start 1.25mg daily, max 10mg daily
Carvedilol (Coreg): Start 3.125mg BID, titrate dose by doubling the dose
every 2 weeks, max 50mg BID
Carvedilol (Coreg CR): start at 10mg daily, max 80mg daily
Metoprolol succinate XR (Toprol XL): Start 12.5–25mg daily, max 200mg
daily
Do not initiate when a patient is decompensated or volume overloaded as initiation
is associated with a transient decline in cardiac output
Taper dose over 1–2 weeks to discontinue
Diuretics
Recommended in patients with HFrEF who have evidence of fluid retention to
improve symptoms (LOE C)
Loop diuretics: Effective in CrCl < 30mL/min
Furosemide (Lasix): Start at 20–40mg daily or BID, max 600mg
Bumetanide (Bumex): Start as 0.5–1mg daily or BID, max 10mg daily
Torsemide (Demadex): Start 10–20mg daily, max 200mg
Hydralazine and Isosorbide Dinitrate (IDN) combination
The combination is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients
self-described as African Americans with NYHA class III-IV HFrEF receiving
optimal therapy with ACEI and β-blockers, unless contraindicated (LOE A)
BiDil: A fixed-dose combination of 37.5mg Hydralazine/20mg IDN: Start 1
tab TID, max 2 tabs TID
266
GEN
The combination can be useful to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients
with current or prior symptomatic HFrEF who cannot be given an ACEI or
ARB because of drug intolerance, hypotension, or renal insufficiency, unless
contraindicated (LOE B)
Start Hydralazine 25–50mg and IDN 20–30mg 3 or 4 ×/daily, max
Hydralazine 300mg/day and IDN 120mg/day; give both drugs in divided
doses
Side-effects include tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, edema, GI toxicity,
lupus-like reaction
Aldosterone receptor antagonists
Recommended in patients with NYHA class II-IV HF and who have LVEF ≤35%
to reduce morbidity and mortality (LOE A)
Patients with NYHA class II HF should have a history of prior CV hospitaliza-
tion or elevated plasma BNP
SCr ≤2.5mg/dL in men or ≤2mg/dL in women (or est. GFR > 30mL/
minute/1.73m2)
Serum K+ < 5mEq/L
Monitor K+, renal function and diuretic dosing at therapy initiation and follow
closely thereafter
Recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality following an acute MI in
patients who have LVEF ≤40% who develop symptoms of HF or have a history of
diabetes (LOE B)
Spironolactone (Aldactone): Start 12.5–25mg daily, max 25mg daily or BID
Eplerenone (Inspra): Start 25mg daily, max 50mg daily
Entresto (Sacubitril/Valsartan) is an angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor
which can be used as a replacement for ACE inhibitor or ARB. The risk of kidney
problems and hyperkalemia is lower than ACE inhibitor or ARB
Recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF NYHA class II or III to reduce
morbidity and mortality (LOE B-R)
Does have risk of hypotension. Recommend 36-hour washout period when
switching to/from ACE inhibitor
Start sacubitril 24mg/valsartan 26mg BID, double dose as tolerated every 2–4
weeks to target maintenance dose of sacubitril 97mg/valsartan 103mg BID
Ivabradine (Corlanor) selectively inhibits the HCN channel in the SA node, providing
rate reduction
Can be beneficial to reduce HF hospitalizations for patients with symptomatic,
stable HFrEF (NYHA class II-III) who are receiving goal-directed therapy
including ß-blocker at maximum tolerated dose, and who are in sinus rhythm with
HR ≥70 at rest (LOE: B-R)
Start 2.5mg BID or 5mg BID, max 7.5mg BID
Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor
(SGLT2i) that promotes glucosuria
Reduces risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2DM and
established CVD and reduces risk of CV death and hospitalization of those with
HFrEF (NYHA class II-IV), with or without T2DM
Start 10mg once daily
Digoxin
Can be beneficial in patients with HFrEF to decrease hospitalizations for HF
(LOE:B)
Digoxin (Lanoxin): 0.125–0.25mg daily
Monitor serum digoxin levels, renal function, and serum K+ as needed
Aspirin: 81mg daily should be given if patient has CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial
fibrillation or valvular dysfunction
Medications which are harmful and should be stopped
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)
Most antiarrhythmic drugs
267
GEN
Most calcium channel blocking drugs
MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION
FRACTION (HFpEF)
Management mimics HFrEF, despite a less robust evidence base
Treat heart failure risk factors (HTN and HLD). Recommended HTN agents include
thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
Treat volume overload with diuretics
The goal of therapy is to slow the rate to allow time for ventricular filling. Few
medications are available to treat diastolic dysfunction, and they should be used with
caution
ß-blockers
Propranolol (Inderal): 60–80mg PO TID–4 ×/day
Metoprolol (Lopressor): 50–100mg PO BID
Timolol (Blocadren): 10mg PO BID
Atenolol (Tenormin): 50mg PO BID or 100mg PO daily
Calcium channel blockers
Diltiazem (Cardizem, Cardizem SR, Cardizem CD, Dilacor XR): 60mg PO TID
initially, may increase to 360mg daily in 3 divided doses
Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Calan SR, Isoptin SR, Verelan): 80mg PO TID initially,
may increase to 480mg in 3 divided doses
Diuretics for symptoms
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common cause of right heart failure is left heart failure
Mortality of diastolic dysfunction is similar to systolic dysfunction
Frequent causes of CHF exacerbations are medication non-compliance or change in diet
(salt)
Patients who are bedridden will manifest their edema as sacral (dependent) edema as
opposed to edema of the lower extremities
Patients with stable CHF should continue to exercise as tolerated
