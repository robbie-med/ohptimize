111. FALLS IN THE ELDERLY
BACKGROUND/EPIDEMIOLOGY: Note: This chapter explores “falls” due to reasons
other than syncope
Falls in the elderly are common: They are the leading cause of death from injury in
persons over age 65
Death rate 10 per 100,000 in persons between ages 65 and 74
147 per 100,000 in persons over age 85
Falls are the leading cause of injury-related ER visits in persons over age 65
Epidemiology: 33% of community dwelling persons and 60% of nursing home residents
fall each year. 20–30% of falls result in moderate to severe injuries that reduce mobility
and independence
Fractures account for 75% of serious injuries
Most common sites are wrist, hip and vertebrae with hip fractures as most severe
25% of elderly persons with hip fractures die within 6 months
95% of hip fractures are due to falls
Over 50% of those who fall have multiple episodes. Women are 3 times as likely to be
hospitalized for fall related injuries. Falls can be marker for functional decline and poor
health. Falls can be non-specific presenting sign of many acute illnesses (pneumonia, UTI,
MI)
Screening all adults older than age 65 annually with H&P and risk factor assessment is
recommended to decrease falls and fall related injuries
EVALUATION: See VI. CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Screening, Assessment, and
Intervention
Demographic: Older age, white race, homebound, living situation
Historical
Fall circumstances and environmental hazards
Previous falls
Acute illness
Chronic conditions, including neuromuscular disorders, anemia, cardiac arrhythmias,
hypertension, CHF, chronic weakness secondary to cancer, etc.
Medications/Substances: May contribute to falls including; alcohol, benzodiazepines,
narcotics, barbiturates, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-hypertensives, cardiac
medications, anti-cholinergics medications, hypoglycemic medications, diuretics,
seizure medications (Carbamazepine toxicity), Phenothiazine and NSAIDs
Others: Use of cane or walker, postprandial hypotension, insomnia, urinary urgency,
pedal/peripheral edema (increased weight of legs may make them difficult to lift)
History: CATASTROPHE mnemonic
C – Caregiver and housing
A – Alcohol (including withdrawal)
T – Treatment (medications including compliance)
A – Affect (depression or lack of initiative)
S – Syncope (any episodes of fainting)
T – Teetering (dizziness)
R – Recent illness
O – Ocular problems
P – Pain with mobility
H – Hearing (necessary to avoid hazards)
E – Environmental hazards

GERI
Physical Exam
Neurological examination: Assessment of cognitive impairment/dementia/delirium,
proprioception, neuropathy, muscle strength
Reduced vision, hearing, proprioception and vestibular function
Gait and mobility assessment: Timed Up and Go test > 9 seconds (age 60–69), >10.2
seconds (age 70–79), >12.7 seconds (age 80–99), 30-Second Chair Stand test, 4-Stage
Balance test
Cardiovascular status: Heart rate and rhythm, postural hypotension
Examination of foot problems and footwear
Musculoskeletal examination: Pain (arthritis), deformity
Testing (if indicated)
Laboratory tests are not routinely performed in event of falls, but may be needed
depending on results of H&P
Consider: CBC, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, Vitamin B12, TSH,
blood cultures, urine analysis, urine culture
EKG, cardiac testing
Imaging studies: To look for etiology of falls and sequelae of falls
Environmental hazards: Most falls are in or around home
Poor lighting (change 60 watts to 100 watt bulbs)
Unsafe stairways
Loose rugs and other tripping hazards
No bathroom grab bars or nonskid bathtubs
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
I HATE FALLING mnemonic
I – Inflammation of joints (or joint deformity)
H – Hypotension (orthostatic BP changes)
A – Auditory and visual abnormalities
T – Tremor (Parkinson’s disease or other causes of tremor)
E – Equilibrium (balance) problem
F – Foot problems
A – Arrhythmia, heart block or valvular disease
L – Leg length discrepancy
L – Lack of conditioning (generalized weakness)
I – Illness
N – Nutrition (poor, weight loss)
G – Gait disturbance
INTERVENTIONS: See VI. CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Screening, Assessment, and
Intervention.
Individualized risk assessment with corresponding multifactorial intervention should
be performed. The general approach is to treat medical conditions, minimize offending
medications, alter environmental hazards, and pursue strength and balance training
Postural hypotension
Decrease dose or discontinue medications causing orthostatic hypotension
Rehydration
Pressure stocking
Dorsiflexion exercises
Behavioral recommendations (elevate head of bed, rise slowly)
If indicated, Fludrocortisone (Florinef) 0.1mg PO BID–TID, Midodrine 10mg PO TID
Dual chamber pacing should be considered for older persons with cardioinhibitory
carotid sinus hypersensitivity with unexplained recurrent falls
Sedative-hypnotic use
Educate regarding appropriate use
Taper and discontinue if possible
Non-benzodiazepine treatment of sleep disorders
505
GERI
Polypharmacy
Review medications frequently, assess for risks and benefits
Minimize or discontinue medication
Check toxicity of medication (e.g., Digoxin) and if medications started recently
Change medications to less centrally acting, short duration of action, less side-effects
and interaction
Environmental hazards
Home safety evaluation and modification of risk factors
Improve lighting (reduce glare, shadows, install night lights)
Remove tripping hazards (loose rugs, uneven floor surfaces, clutter)
Improve stairways safety (secure handrails, contrasting tape on steps, nonskid
surfaces)
Improve bathroom safety (grab bars, nonskid bathtub, and raised toilets seats)
If patient is confined to bed, bed rails, bedside cushions
Gait and mobility impairment
Balance and gait training, strengthening exercise, Tai Chi
Appropriate footwear, treat foot disorders (callus, bunion)
Proper assistive devices (cane, walker)
Check vitamin deficiency and cervical spondylosis
Reduced muscle strength or joint range of motion-muscle strengthening exercises
(resistance exercises)
Sensory deficit (reduced vision, hearing or vestibular dysfunction)
Refraction, cataract extraction
Hearing aid, cerumen removal
ENT and ophthalmology evaluation
Dementia
Increase supervision
Orientation cues
Interventions to reduce fall-related injuries
Osteoporosis screening and treatment
Personal emergency response systems
PREVENTION
Strategies
The American Geriatric Society (AGS) and British Geriatrics society (BGS)
recommend that all adults over age 65 be screened annually for falls or balance
impairment
All community dwelling elderly, nursing home residents and elderly recently
hospitalized for extended period should receive multifactorial risk assessment and
interventions tailored to their need
Correct environmental hazards, medications modifications, hip protectors and
protective flooring
Home support, involve family, physical and occupational therapy, balance and
strengthening training and provide follow-up
Vitamin D supplementation
Elderly patients with Vitamin D deficiency are at a greater risk for loss of muscle
strength and muscle mass and subsequent falls
In a meta-analysis of 5 RCTs, Vitamin D use reduced the risk of falls in the elderly by
22% compared to placebo (JAMA 2004; 291:1999, reference below), RCT of nursing
home residents showed Vitamin D supplementation of 800 IU daily reduced fall
incidence by 50% over 5 months compared to placebo (Broe KE, Chen TC, Weinberg
J, et al., J Am Geriatr Soc 2007;55(2):234-9.)
AGS/BGS and U.S. preventive task force recommend Vitamin D supplementation of
at least 800 IU per day for those at increased risk of falls
Exercise (balance, strength, and gait training) is another extremely important
component of fall prevention

CLINICAL PEARLS
Falls most often multifactorial with influence from declining sensory function, strength
and balance combined with coexistent medical conditions, medication side-effects and
environmental hazards
Elderly patients on benzodiazepines have a 29 times increased risk of falling
In elderly women with hip fractures, mortality is approximately 20% in the first year
507
GERI
Confusion may be reason for fall or result of fall. Subdural hematoma is treatable and often
overlooked sequelae of falling
Moderate-risk patients should start Vitamin D supplementation, have a medication review,
and be referred to physical therapy
High-risk patients should start an exercise program, Vitamin D supplementation,
medication management, home environment modification, and management of risk factors
Recommendations from the Choosing Wisely Campaign (See References)
◦Do not use benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics in older adults as first choice for
insomnia, agitation, or delirium
◦Do not prescribe a medication without conducting a drug regimen review
◦Do not prescribe under-dosed strength training programs for older adults. Instead, match
the frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise to the individual’s abilities and goals
