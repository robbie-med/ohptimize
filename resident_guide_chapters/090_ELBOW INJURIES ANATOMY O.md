90. ELBOW INJURIES
ANATOMY
Olecranon humeral joint is a hinge joint
Radius articulates with capitulum and the ulna with trochlea
Lateral joint space is supported by radial and ulnar collateral ligament complexes
Upper extremity is innervated by 5 nerve branches that originate at brachial plexus
(axillary, radial, musculocutaneous, ulnar and median nerves). Ulnar nerve is found easily
by palpation in groove behind medial epicondyle
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
In adults most injuries occur to ligaments, tendons, or bone itself
In children, the weakest links are the growth plates, apophysis and epiphysis
Tendon damage often occurs secondary to overuse and microrupture
Repetitive strains may lead to ligament damage, chondromalacia, osteophytes, tendinosis,
neuritis, loose bodies, or osteochondritis dissecans
Overhead throwing can lead to medial tension overload, lateral compression, and
posterior olecranon impaction
ELBOW PAIN BY ANATOMIC LOCATION
Lateral elbow pain
Lateral epicondylitis (“Tennis elbow”): Overload of forearm extensors, mainly
extensor carpi radialis brevis causing microscopic ruptures and inflammation at the
insertion to the bone
History: Patient complains of pain, especially with combing hair, playing tennis or
golf, shaking hands. Occupational overuse of wrist extensors/forearm supinators is
more common than recreational
Physical exam: Pain over the tendon about 1–2cm distal to the lateral epicondyle.
Pain is exacerbated by active supination of the forearm or extension of the wrist
Management: Conservative therapy with ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy
is usually successful including eccentric exercises for the extensor muscles
and treatment of existing somatic dysfunction. If not better after 1–2 weeks
consider steroid injection (See Chapter 93, Corticosteroid Injection of Joints).
Autologous blood injection or platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a treatment option
with hypothetical benefit. Other important therapies are enforced proper technique,
decreased string tension on racquet, applying a cushioned grip, and use of counter
force bracing. Strengthening of the muscle may be accomplished by extending the
fingers with an elastic band stretched over them or by reverse wrist curls. If not
better after 6–12 months, consider surgery
Radial nerve entrapment
History: Patient complains of local pain, paresthesias, dull ache with history of
repetitive forearm supination and pronation
Physical exam: Pain in forearm often with radiation proximal and distal. Pain, and
possibly weakness, exacerbated by supination and resisted extension of middle
finger with wrist in neutral position. Point of maximal tenderness usually resides
over the anterior radial head. May be aggravated by counter bracing
Management: Rest, NSAIDs, and rehabilitation. Surgical release for resistant cases
Think of radial nerve entrapment in cases of resistant tennis elbow
Radiocapitellar overload syndrome
History: Pain with overhead throwing
410
MUSC
Caused by radial head impaction on the capitellum during valgus stress of
the elbow accompanied by medial instability. May consist of radiocapitellar
chondromalacia, radiocapitellar degeneration, osteochondral fracture, or loose
bodies
Physical exam: Patient will have lateral pain and occasionally locking of the elbow
Medial elbow pain
Medial epicondylitis (“Golfer’s elbow”)
History: Sharp pain, trouble lifting objects
Physical exam: Pain at the common flexor origin. Sometimes affects pronator
teres and flexor carpi radialis as well. Pain with resisted flexion, pronation (most
sensitive), and passive extension
Management: If 1 week of conservative treatment (ice, NSAIDs) not helpful,
consider steroid injection. Autologous blood injection or platelet rich plasma
(PRP) is a treatment option with hypothetical benefit. Consider treatment of
somatic dysfunction in flexor muscles as well. Squeezing a soft ball or wrist curls
help strengthen the muscles involved. Surgery only in resistant cases
Medial elbow instability
History: Pain over medial elbow involving the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL)
usually during acceleration phase of throwing
Physical exam: Focal tenderness 2cm distal to medial epicondyle, decreased range
of motion, pain with valgus stress, and asymmetric valgus laxity between elbows
X-ray: May see small avulsion fracture on x-ray. Stress radiographs may help in
diagnosis
Management: In acute UCL tears, conservative measures are treatment of choice
for non-athletes. Elite athletes may respond better to surgery (“Tommy John
Surgery”). About 50% of chronic tears will respond to conservative measures
alone
Cubital tunnel syndrome
History: Localized pain with paresthesia
Acute pain over medial elbow with radiation down arm caused by repeated
traction, compression, or friction on nerve
Physical exam: There may be numbness or tingling in the 4th and 5th digits. The
nerve may sublux out of the cubital tunnel, feel doughy or thick, and there may be
a positive Tinel’s sign on exam
Management: Conservative measures preferred. May splint at 30° if chronic
subluxation of nerve present
Chronic cases can be diagnosed with EMG testing to evaluate nerve function
Posterior elbow pain
Triceps tendinitis
History and physical exam: Pain over triceps tendon exacerbated by resisted elbow
extension
Management: Initial management with ice, NSAIDs, physical therapy. Rupture is
rare and treated by direct surgical repair
Valgus extension overload syndrome
Insidious onset of pain with full extension exacerbated by valgus stress. Caused by
impingement of the olecranon allowed by ulnar collateral instability and repetitive
valgus stress
Physical exam: May find tenderness at the tip of the olecranon with the elbow in
45° of flexion
X-ray: May reveal osteophytes of the olecranon
Management: Conservative measures preferred, but if osteophytes present, surgery
may be required
Stress fracture of the olecranon
Pain over olecranon with throwing. Due to the repetitive sudden snap at full
extension. May need bone scan or CT to diagnose if not seen on x-ray
Management: Rest if the fracture is stable. Surgery if conservative measures fail

MUSC
Triceps apophysitis
Seen in children, similar to Osgood-Schlatter’s disease of the knee. Patient has
pain with resisted extension and is tender over the olecranon
Management: Internal fixation with bone grafting
Olecranon bursitis
Presents with a distended soft posterior elbow
Management: Ice and compression. May aspirate the bursa if elbow has decreased
range of motion. Send for fluid analysis to ensure not infectious. Can inject with
steroids
Anterior elbow pain
Biceps tendinopathy: Insidious course, pain with resisted flexion and supination of the
forearm
Anterior capsule stretch or tear: Can occur secondary to fall on extended elbow,
resisted flexion, forceful supination, hyperextension, or direct trauma. Conservative
measures are recommended
Pronator teres syndrome: Radiating forearm pain with numbness and tingling in
distribution of median nerve. Physical exam reveals pain with active pronation and
resisted long finger extension
Distal biceps tendon rupture
Most often occurs when the elbow is flexed to 90° and the contraction is overcome
by a sudden extension force
Physical exam will reveal a palpable deformity, balling of the biceps muscle,
decreased strength in elbow flexion and supination, and ecchymosis in the
antecubital fossa
Acute surgical anatomic repair is treatment of choice
Subluxation of the radial head (nursemaid’s elbow)
Definition and mechanism of injury
Subluxation of radial head is common among preschool children. After age 7
radial head is larger than radial neck and subluxation is not common
Mechanism of injury is sudden traction on the hand with the elbow extended and
the forearm pronated. Forceful traction fibers, which encircle the radial neck, slip
and become trapped between the radial head and capitellum
History
Important to elicit a history of traction on the child’s hand; the act may have been
unrecognized by the parent or the history withheld because of a feeling of guilt
About 50% of the radial head subluxations present with an atypical history
Physical exam
Child may present irritable, playful or comfortably in parents’ lap. Common
symptom is unwillingness to use the extremity
Any child not using an arm that is flexed and pronated and without signs of trauma
should be considered to have a radial head subluxation, unless history strongly
suggests another diagnosis
Evaluation: Radiographs are not necessary, unless another diagnosis is being
considered or if reduction is not accomplished
Management
Reduction is carried out by firmly placing the thumb over the radial head while
the other hand is placed on the wrist. Forearm is fully supinated. If a “click” is not
felt, elbow is flexed. Maneuver may be repeated if initial attempt does not reduce
subluxation
If a second attempt is not successful, then x-ray elbow
Reduction as evidenced by a “click” is highly predictive and will result in relief
from pain and, shortly thereafter, use of the affected arm
After first subluxation, no immobilization is required. For recurrent subluxations,
patient’s arm should be immobilized in a sling. Should be referred for orthopedic
consultation

CLINICAL PEARLS
“Little League Elbow” is actually a constellation of diseases seen in skeletally immature
athletes including medial epicondylar apophysitis, osteochondrosis of the radial head,
osteochondrosis of the capitellum, and non-union of a stress fracture of the olecranon
epiphysis. This is an overuse condition caused by chronic overhead throwing
If triceps tendinitis doesn’t heal, consider an olecranon stress fracture
Encourage proper sporting technique, stretching, strengthening, and proper fitting
equipment
