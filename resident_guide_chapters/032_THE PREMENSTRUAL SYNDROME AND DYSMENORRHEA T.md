32. THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME AND
DYSMENORRHEA
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
—PART ONE: THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS)—
DEFINITION: A condition characterized by debilitating affective, behavioral, cognitive,
and somatic complaints which interferes with normal functioning. Develops in the 7–14 days
before menses and subsides with the onset of menstruation
PREVALENCE AND STATISTICS
Age of affected women is 25–40
Affects about 33% of premenopausal women
40–50% of women presenting to the physician with premenstrual complaints will meet
criteria for PMS
Premenstrual symptoms affect up to 75% of women and clinically significant PMS
occurs in 20–30% of women
ETIOLOGY: No specific deficiency or abnormality has been identified. Theories include
Deficiency of progesterone—now mostly disregarded
Alterations in ovarian hormone production/derangements in relative amounts of estrogen
and progesterone—no abnormal hormone levels found
Alterations at the hypothalamic or supra hypothalamic level
SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS: There are no diagnostic physical signs of PMS
Affective: Irritability, emotional lability, anxiety, depression
Behavioral: Food cravings, hostility, aggression, altered libido
Cognitive: Forgetfulness, poor concentration, confusion
Somatic: Bloating, fluid retention, weight gain, headache, mastalgia, fatigue, insomnia
DIAGNOSIS based on the following
Symptom complex consistent with PMS as above
Symptoms must occur exclusively in the luteal phase
Symptoms must be severe enough to interfere with normal functioning
Prospective symptom report over a period of at least 2 or 3 cycles
Exclusion of other psychological and physical disorders by detailed history and physical
exam
MANAGEMENT: No one treatment is effective for everyone with PMS. It is important to
educate and reassure the patient and tailor the treatment to the individual. It may take time to
find the best option for each patient
Lifestyle changes: Try as initial approach

OB-GYN
Nutrition
Avoid refined sugar, salt, red meat, alcohol, and caffeine
A good PMS diet consists of 60% complex carbohydrates, 20% protein, 20% fat
Rely more on fish, poultry, whole grains, and legumes for protein, and less on red
meats and dairy products
Nutritional supplements may be helpful
Calcium Carbonate—600mg elemental calcium twice daily
Vitamin E—400units/day: May reduce mood symptoms and food cravings
Vitamin B6—up to 100mg/day
Evening primrose oil may relieve breast tenderness
Avoid smoking
Aerobic exercise
Stress management: Identify stressors first, then look for ways to deal with them
Adequate sleep
Medications
SSRIs: These are effective for relieving tension, irritability, and dysphoria. Fluoxetine
(Sarafem), Sertraline (Zoloft) and Paroxetine (Paxil CR) have been approved for
the indication of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). All SSRIs are probably
equally effective
Oral contraceptive pills: The simplest method for inducing anovulation. More effective
than placebo
GnRH agonists: Lupron, Depot-Lupron. Cause a medical menopause with menopausal
side-effects. Not recommended for > 6 months
Danazol: Effective therapy but has adverse side-effects
Diuretics: Spironolactone has not been consistently shown to be effective
Surgery: TAH and BSO is last resort. GnRH agonists should be used first to predict
response to oophorectomy
—PART TWO: PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA—
DEFINITION: Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation without detectable pelvic
disease. Secondary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation associated with an anatomic cause
(endometriosis, adhesions, fibroids, other anomalies)
PREVALENCE: Frequency decreased after age 20. Affects 50–90% of reproductive-aged
women
ETIOLOGY: Increased endometrial prostaglandin production causing higher uterine tone and
decreased blood flow
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Abdominal cramping: May radiate to the back or inner thighs
Onset usually begins many hours prior to menstruation with most severe cramping
occurring on the first day
Cramping may last anywhere from several hours up to 2–3 days
Dizziness, headache, flushing
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
Depression
DIAGNOSIS: Exclude pelvic pathology with thorough history and physical exam. Consider
cultures and other diagnostic studies as indicated
MANAGEMENT
Primary dysmenorrhea
NSAIDs are treatment of choice. Begin with onset of bleeding and continue for 2–3
days
Oral contraceptive pills
126
OB-GYN
Exercise, yoga, and sexual activity may also reduce menstrual symptoms
Heat applied to lower abdomen is also effective treatment
Secondary dysmenorrhea: Causes often include endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory
disease, submucous myoma, IUD use, cervical stenosis. Address underlying cause
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients who experience mood swings with PMS can also develop mild to moderate
depression, which is known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be an effective treatment
Patients who complain of worsening abdominal cramping with each period or who
complain of pain not associated with menstruation may have secondary dysmenorrhea
(e.g., endometriosis, fibroids)
