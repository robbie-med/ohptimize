31. MENOPAUSE AND HORMONE
REPLACEMENT THERAPY
DEFINITION (World Health Organization): “The permanent cessation of menstrual
periods that occurs naturally or is induced by surgery, chemotherapy or radiation.” Natural
menopause is diagnosed after 12 months of amenorrhea. Diagnosis can also be based on
symptoms of menopause. Mean age 52 (range 40–58)
SIGNS: Perimenopause begins with skipped periods, increased or decreased interval between
menses, or long or heavy bleeding
SYMPTOMS: Vasomotor (hot flashes, sweating), insomnia, nervousness, atrophic
vaginitis, urinary atrophy (stress or urge incontinence), skin atrophy (wrinkles), osteoporosis,
arteriosclerosis. Symptoms last from several months to several years. Some women may be
asymptomatic
DIAGNOSIS
If patient has 3 months of amenorrhea: Obtain FSH level or give Provera to stimulate
withdrawal bleeding
Obtain FSH level: Sequential measurements may be helpful
If FSH is high (> 40mIU/mL), then patient is in menopause. The pituitary is trying
to stimulate ovulation, but patient is in menopause/ovarian failure. Consider
starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if severe menopausal symptoms (See
IV below)
If FSH is low (< 40mIU/mL), then the patient is not in menopause. May be
perimenopausal. Cycle with Provera 10mg daily (or Prometrium 400mg BID)
× 7 days per month if patient wants to induce menses
Withdrawal bleeding: Provera 10mg daily × 7 days
If there is no withdrawal bleeding, then repeat in 3 months. If she still has no
withdrawal bleeding, assume she is in menopause. Consider starting HRT if severe
menopausal symptoms (See IV below)
If there is withdrawal bleeding, then patient is not in menopause
If patient is having symptoms (hot flashes, etc.) and is not amenorrheic and FSH is
elevated (> 20mIU/mL), then she is in the transitional phase and menopause will most
likely occur in the next several years
These patients may be placed on low dose oral contraceptives, such as Loestrin 1/20,
for symptom relief. Patients should be free of the following risk factors: hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, previous thromboembolic disorders,
cerebrovascular disease or coronary artery disease
Cyclic progestins may be used for women who are not candidates for OCP. One
approach is Provera 10mg daily (or Prometrium 400mg BID) for 10 days each month
to induce withdrawal bleeding and decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia
If the patient is on oral contraceptives, measure the FSH on the 6th day of the pill-free
interval. If FSH > 40mIU/mL, then change to HRT
If patient has heavy menses (passing clots or social inconvenience) for 3 months,
bleeding between menses for 3–4 months, or 3 consecutive months of menses lasting
longer than 7 days, then perform Pipelle biopsy and/or transvaginal ultrasound.
Manifestations of malignancy (bleeding) must not be dismissed as early menopause

MANAGEMENT OF MENOPAUSE
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Recent studies, including the Women’s Health
Initiative (16,000 postmenopausal women on combination HRT followed for 5 years), have
shown increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, coronary heart disease, pulmonary embolism
and dementia in postmenopausal women in their 60s and 70s. Due to these findings the
USPSTF recommends against the use of both combined estrogen and progestin and
unopposed estrogen in the prevention of chronic issues. However, it is felt that the benefits
outweigh the risks for HRT in low risk, symptomatic women < 60 years of age or less than
10 years from menopause for the management of menopausal symptoms
The primary indication for hormone therapy is the treatment of moderate to severe
vasomotor symptoms. Potential consequences of severe vasomotor symptoms include
diminished sleep quality, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and subsequently reduced
quality of life (QOL)
According to recommendations from the North American Menopause Society
(NAMS), the decision to use HRT should be individualized and incorporate the
woman’s health and quality of life priorities as well as her personal risk factors, such
as risk of venous thrombosis, CHD, stroke, and breast cancer
Vasomotor symptoms: All systemic HRT products except ultralow-dose estradiol
transdermal patch have the FDA indication for this use
Vaginal atrophy: Use low-dose local vaginal estrogen therapy (ET)
Progestogen is used to negate the increased risk of endometrial cancer from systemic
ET use
All women with an intact uterus who use systemic ET should be prescribed with
Progestogen
Women without a uterus do not need a Progestogen when prescribed systemic
ET
Progestogen is generally not indicated when low-dose local (vaginal) ET is
administered for vaginal atrophy
Systemic HRT dosage
Estrogen: Use the lowest effective dose—0.3mg to 0.625mg oral conjugate equine
estrogen (Premarin), 0.5mg to 1.0mg oral micronized 17-β-estradiol (Estrace), or
0.014mg to 0.0375mg transdermal 17-β-estradiol patch
Progestin: Starting at the lowest effective doses of 2.5mg medroxyprogesterone
acetate (Provera), 0.35mg Norethindrone acetate, 3mg Drospirenone, 0.075mg
Levonorgestrel, or 100mg micronized Progesterone
