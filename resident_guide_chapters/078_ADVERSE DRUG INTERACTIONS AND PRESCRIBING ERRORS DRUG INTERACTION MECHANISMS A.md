78. ADVERSE DRUG INTERACTIONS AND
PRESCRIBING ERRORS
DRUG INTERACTION MECHANISMS
Absorption of one drug can be reduced by another drug, e.g., Cholestyramine
Protein/tissue binding displacement can be important especially if the displacing drug
also reduces the elimination of the object drug
Metabolism of one drug can be enhanced by an “enzyme-inducing” agent, e.g.,
Phenobarbital
Many commonly prescribed medications interfere with or are metabolized by the
hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The CyP450 system refers to a collection of
iso-enzymes that are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of many endogenous and
exogenous compounds
Altered renal excretion can be caused by reduced excretion or change in urinary pH
Pharmacodynamic interaction occurs when drugs with either additive or antagonistic
properties are given concomitantly
SELECTED CLINICALLY RELEVANT DRUG INTERACTIONS
The following Table is not comprehensive.
Drugs in parentheses are important examples of that class of drug.

PREVENTING MEDICATION PRESCRIBING ERRORS
Confirm that patient’s weight is correct for weight-based dosages. Write patient’s weight
on the prescription
Identify drug allergies in patients and reconfirm each time when writing a prescription
Give patient oral and written instructions without using abbreviations
Specify exact dosage strength. When writing for narcotics specify quantity in numerals
and written out, e.g., #20 (twenty)
Avoid use of a terminal zero to the right of the decimal point (e.g., use 5 rather than 5.0)
to minimize 10-fold dosing errors
Use a zero to the left of a dose less than 1 (e.g., use 0.1 rather than .1) to avoid 10-fold
dosing errors
Spell out dosage units rather than using abbreviations
Ensure that prescriptions and signatures are legible

EXAMPLES OF DRUGS THAT MAY CAUSE RENAL TOXICITY
NSAIDs: Decrease renal perfusion, may cause interstitial nephritis and nephrotic
syndrome
ACE inhibitors, ARBS, Aliskiren: Cause renal failure in patients with bilateral renal
artery stenosis
Aminoglycosides: Direct tubular injury occurring 7–10 days after initiation of treatment
Amphotericin B: Direct tubular injury
Cyclosporine: Prerenal, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura—hemolytic uremic
syndrome, or chronic renal failure
Radiographic contrast dye: Prerenal and acute tubular necrosis
Foscarnet, Ganciclovir, Pentamidine
EXAMPLES OF DRUGS THAT MAY CAUSE HEPATIC TOXICITY
Acetaminophen: Direct toxic reactions
Alcohol: Cirrhosis
Amiodarone: Fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis
Estradiol: Cholestatic reactions
Isoniazid: Idiosyncratic reactions
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors: Mild elevations in AST/ACT, cholestatic injury
Phenytoin: Allergic hepatitis
Sustained-release nicotinic acid: Ischemic damage
Vitamin A: Indolent cirrhosis
GRAPEFRUIT-DRUG INTERACTIONS: Grapefruit juice can inhibit intestinal CYP
3SA4 and increase plasma concentration of the following drugs
Antiarrhythmics
Calcium channel blockers
Statins
Immunosuppressants (Cyclosporine)
Protease inhibitors (Saquinavir)
CLINICAL PEARLS
Older age and polypharmacy are risk factors for clinically significant drug interactions
Always be alert for potential drug interactions with drugs that have narrow therapeutic
indexes. e.g., antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, Lithium, MAOIs, nonsedating
antihistamines, Theophylline, and Warfarin
If the patient is stabilized on the object drug, it may be necessary to adjust the dose when
starting, stopping or altering the dose of the precipitant drug
Monitoring of serum drug concentrations may be useful in adjusting drug dosage
Educate patient regarding early signs of a possible drug interaction and monitor carefully
the clinical response of the patient
The onset of drug interactions may vary, depending on the time required to reach the
steady-state concentration of the precipitant drug
Alcohol may potentiate the CNS effects of antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics,
benzodiazepines, narcotics, and sedatives. Alcohol can cause a disulfiram-like reaction
(flushing, palpitations, tachycardia, nausea etc.) when it is taken concurrently with
Metronidazole or Chlorpropamide
