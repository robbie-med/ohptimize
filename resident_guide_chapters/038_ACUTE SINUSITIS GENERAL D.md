38. ACUTE SINUSITIS
GENERAL
Definition: Mucosal inflammation of 1 or more paranasal sinuses. The term rhinosinusitis
has been suggested to replace acute sinusitis. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is usually
a secondary infection resulting from sinus ostia obstruction or impairment of mucus
clearance mechanisms caused by an acute viral upper respiratory tract
Rhinosinusitis is a common diagnosis in ambulatory care and results in approximately 25
million U.S. physician office visits every year. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are most
commonly involved
Most cases presenting in the ambulatory setting are caused by viruses, not bacteria
Patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) usually present with one of the
following
Persistent signs and symptoms, lasting ≥10 days without any clinical improvement
Severe symptoms (fever ≥39°C, purulent nasal discharge or facial pain) lasting ≥3–4
days
Worsening or “double-sickening” (≥3–4 days)
Sinus radiography is not recommended
Most cases resolve without antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics should be reserved for those
with severe symptoms
ETIOLOGY
Bacterial pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, and S.
pyogenes
Viral: Multiple pathogens
PHYSICAL EXAM
Purulence in the nares or nasopharynx (not always visible)
Irritation of the nasal mucosa: Leads to inflammation with a bright red, irregular
appearance
Nasal polyps: Prolonged nasal inflammation may lead to polypoid degeneration of nasal
mucosa and formation of polyps
Facial tenderness to palpation or percussion
Maxillary: Subzygomatic over cheek and upper teeth
Ethmoid: Periorbital
Frontal: Forehead above eyebrow
Sphenoid
Usually retrobulbar, often not well localized
Infection in sphenoid sinus may lead to pain and tenderness over vertex of skull,
mastoid bones, and occipital portion of head
Periorbital tissue swelling or erythema of skin overlying affected sinus may be seen
CLASSIFICATION
Acute: Symptom duration < 4 weeks
Subacute: Symptom duration 4–12 weeks
Recurrent acute: ≥4 episodes per year with complete resolution between episodes; each
episode lasts ≥7 days
Chronic: Symptom duration > 12 weeks

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
Radiography
Plain films. No longer recommended due to the poor sensitivity and specificity
Sinus CT Scan
In general, high sensitivity but poor specificity as many patients with viral
rhinosinusitis and viral URIs will have positive sinus CTs. However, one study
found that when characteristic CT findings are combined with a high clinical
likelihood, the positive predictive value is about 90%
Not necessary to obtain in an uncomplicated acute sinusitis. Should be performed
when diagnosis is in question
Rhinoscopy (flexible):Allows a detailed examination of the upper nasal cavities and
posterior nasopharynx. Technique is also valuable in identifying polyps in the high nasal
vault, and structural abnormalities
Transillumination: Technique has been unreliable in diagnosing acute sinusitis
MEDICAL TREATMENT
Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as the clinical diagnosis of acute
bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is established
When choosing an antibiotic, consider risk for antibiotic resistance, efficacy, and cost
Risk for antibiotic resistance
Age < 2 or > 65, daycare
Prior antibiotics within the past month
Prior hospitalization past 5 days
Comorbidities
Immunocompromised
If no risk for antibiotic resistance, the first-line antibiotic therapy is Amoxicillin-
Clavulanate (Augmentin) 500mg/125mg PO TID or 875mg/125mg PO BID. If
improvement occurs after 3–5 days, complete 5–7 days of antibiotic therapy
If there is risk for antibiotic resistance, use high-dose Amoxicillin-Clavulanate
(Augmentin XR) 2000mg/125mg PO BID. If improvement occurs after 3–5 days, complete
7–10 days of antibiotic therapy
If worsening or no improvement after 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy, switch to high-dose
Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Augmentin XR) 2000mg/125mg PO BID
Alternative to high-dose Amoxicillin-Clavulanate: Doxycycline 100mg BID or 200mg
daily
In β-lactam allergy, use Doxycycline 100mg BID. Consider Levofloxacin (Levaquin)
500mg PO daily. The FDA safety review recommends fluoroquinolones should be reserved
for patients without other alternative treatment options
Macrolides (Clarithromycin and Azithromycin) are no longer recommended for empiric
therapy due to high rates of resistance among S. pneumoniae (~30%)
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is not recommended for empiric therapy
because of high rates of resistance among both S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae
(~30–40%)
Second-and third-generation oral cephalosporins are no longer recommended for
empiric monotherapy of ABRS due to variable rates of resistance among S. pneumoniae.
Combination therapy with a third-generation oral cephalosporin (Cefixime or
Cefpodoxime) plus Clindamycin may be used as second-line therapy for children with
non-type I penicillin allergy or from geographic regions with high endemic rates of PNS S.
pneumoniae
IN CHILDREN
First line: Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 45mg/kg/day divided PO BID for mild to moderate
disease with no risk factors for antibiotic resistance
Second-line: Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 90mg/kg/day divided PO BID for use in children
with one or more risk factors for antibiotic resistance
β-lactam allergy

ID
Type I hypersensitivity: Levofloxacin 10–20mg/kg/day PO every12–24 hours. FDA
safety review recommends fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients without
other alternative treatment options
Non-type 1 hypersensitivity: Clindamycin 30–40mg/kg/day PO TID plus Cefixime
(Suprax) 8mg/kg/day PO BID or Cefpodoxime (Vantin) 10mg/kg/day divided PO BID
Risk for antibiotic resistance or failed initial therapy
Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 90mg/kg/day BID—OR—
Clindamycin 30–40mg/kg/day PO TID plus Cefixime (Suprax) 8mg/kg/day PO BID or
Cefpodoxime (Vantin) 10mg/kg/day PO BID
Levofloxacin 10–20mg/kg/day divided PO every 12–24 hours. FDA safety review
recommends fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients without other alternative
treatment options
Vomiting children may be given a single dose of Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg/day IM or IV.
Therapy with oral antibiotic should start 24 hours after the parenteral dose was given
provided vomiting has resolved
ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES
Analgesics: Acetaminophen or an NSAID given alone or in combination is appropriate
for mild to moderate pain
Decongestants: May be used to reduce mucosal edema and facilitate aeration and drainage
during acute episodes. The effect of decongestants is limited in the nasal cavity and does
not extend to the paranasal sinuses. Topical decongestants should not be used longer than 3
days because of the risk of rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa)
Antihistamines should be reserved for patients with known allergies
Saline nasal irrigation may be used to soften viscous secretions and improve mucociliary
clearance. In children, use a bulb syringe to irrigate 3‒4 times daily as needed
Guaifenesin, a mucolytic, is not recommended due to lack of evidence for its effectiveness
Intranasal steroids are minimally absorbed and have a low incidence of systemic
adverse effects. The data on intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy for acute sinusitis are
limited. They may be effective in patients with less severe symptoms at baseline. Current
guidelines consider them an option based on individualized decision
TREATMENT FAILURE DESPITE ABOVE APPROACHES
CT scan to obtain definitive diagnosis—sensitive but not specific. X-rays are rarely useful
for diagnosis in this setting
Antibiotics: Consider using a different second line agent for 4–6 weeks in conjunction
with nasal steroids and a decongestant
Referral to an allergist or ENT
RECURRENT OR CHRONIC SINUSITIS
In children the most common cause of recurrent sinusitis is recurrent viral upper
respiratory infection
Other conditions predisposing patients to chronic sinusitis include allergic
inflammation, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency disorders (insufficient or dysfunctional
immunoglobulins), ciliary dyskinesia (immotile cilia syndrome, Kartagener’s syndrome),
nasal polyps, or an anatomical problem
Evaluation of children with recurrent or chronic sinusitis may include consulting an
allergist, a sweat test, measurement of immunoglobulins and their subclasses, and possibly
a mucosal biopsy (to assess ciliary function and structure)
COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE SINUSITIS (AND TREATMENT)
Periorbital cellulitis: Manifested by eye swelling, exophthalmos, and imparted/painful
extraocular movements
Intracranial abscess: Manifested by signs of increased intracranial pressure, meningeal
irritation, and focal neurologic deficits
Meningitis

CLINICAL PEARLS
Before committing a patient to the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, consider radiologic
studies
Three most common causes of chronic cough (90–95%) are post-nasal drip (often
secondary to sinusitis), asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Acute rhinosinusitis is often viral in origin. Physicians prescribe an antibiotic 85–98% of
the time
Pseudomonas may be a pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis
Patients with HIV can present with recurrent sinusitis
