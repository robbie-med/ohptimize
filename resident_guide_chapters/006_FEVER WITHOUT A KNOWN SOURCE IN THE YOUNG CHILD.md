6. FEVER WITHOUT A KNOWN SOURCE IN
THE YOUNG CHILD (BIRTH–3 YEARS-OLD)
DEFINITION: Acute febrile illness where the etiology of the fever is not apparent after a
careful history and physical exam
Fever is defined as rectal temperature ≥100.4º F (38.0º C)
Axillary, oral, and tympanic temperature are not as reliable
Concern for occult bacteremia or underlying sepsis highest in infants birth to 3 months
with temperature ≥100.4º F (38.0º C) and in infants 3–36 months of age with a
temperature ≥102.2º F (39.0º C)
A finding of otitis media on exam should not be considered the sole cause of fever
in this age group; the incidence or bacteremia does not differ significantly in febrile
infants and young children with or without otitis media
This chapter assumes children 3–6 months of age do not have an obvious source
of infection after careful history and physical exam. This chapter also assumes
the children are low risk patients (no history or chronic or immunosuppressive
illness, prematurity, unvaccinated) and do not appear toxic or septic. If toxic or
septic appearing, then immediately refer child to the emergency department for full
evaluation
Response to antipyretic medication does not lower risk of serious bacterial infection
RELEVANCE AND RISK FACTORS
Children with fever without a known source may have occult bacteremia which can lead
to more significant sequelae
Occult bacteremia occurs in 1–2% of well-appearing children with fever aged 3–36
months
Of those, approximately 17% have focal infection (pneumonia, cellulitis, UTI,
osteomyelitis, etc.) and about 1.7% are found to have meningitis or sepsis, the most
serious sequelae
Summary: Of children 3–36 months of age with fever without source, 0.3% will
develop significant sequelae and 0.03% will develop meningitis or sepsis (the most
serious sequelae)
Prevalence of UTI in children 2 months to 2 years of age with fever without source is
3–8% (girls > boys). UTI is the most common serious bacterial infection in this age group.
Symptoms of UTI are nonspecific and may include vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, and
poor feeding. Risk of untreated UTI is renal scarring and subsequent risk of HTN and renal
failure. Obtaining clean catch urine specimens can be challenging in the outpatient setting,
catheterization may be required
Known chronic illness (leukemia, sickle cell, HIV, congenital heart anomalies) place the
infant in high-risk category, low threshold for ED evaluation
Recent antibiotic therapy may alter presentation of a serious bacterial infection
Day-care attendance may place infant at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal
infection. Review immunization history for completed pneumococcal series
FEVER WITHOUT A KNOWN SOURCE IN CHILDREN < 28 DAYS-OLD
Temperature > 100.4º F (Approximately 10% will harbor a serious bacterial infection). All
fevers in this age group are considered high risk for serious bacterial infection
Risk factors: Prematurity, premature rupture of membranes (> 18 hours),
chorioamnionitis, maternal fever, maternal UTI, twin pregnancy, meconium aspiration
Signs and symptoms of bacteremia or focal serious infection: Temperature instability,

PEDS
respiratory distress, lethargy, poor feeding, jaundice, diarrhea, tachycardia, seizures, skin
rash, parental concern
Management
All true fevers in the first 28 days of life should have a diagnostic evaluation
(including H&P, CBC, blood/urine cultures, and lumbar puncture). Most common
bacterial etiologies vary by gestational age
Requires hospital admission including CBC with differential, blood culture, UA
and urine culture, lumbar puncture and chest x-ray. If diarrhea present, obtain stool
culture and fecal WBC count. Begin empiric parenteral antibiotics after cultures have
been obtained: Ampicillin plus Gentamycin (preferred regimen) or Ampicillin plus
Cefotaxime (alternate regimen)
FEVER WITHOUT A KNOWN SOURCE IN CHILDREN 1–3 MONTHS-OLD
Evaluation should include H&P and urinalysis. ED evaluation should be considered but
is not required in all cases
Several risk assessment tools are available to help assess risk of serious bacterial
infection. Any ill-appearing children (increased respiratory effort, lethargy, delayed
capillary refill, petechial rash) are considered high-risk. All tools require labwork and
urinalysis
Rochester Criteria (requires CBC with differential)
Step-by-Step (requires CBC with diff, procalcitonin, CRP)
Laboratory score (requires procalcitonin, CRP)
Management
For any high-risk children (ill-appearing or screen positive on any of the above scoring
criteria), should have full ED evaluation including lumbar puncture
For low-risk children, can consider outpatient management with close follow-up
FEVER WITHOUT A KNOWN SOURCE IN CHILDREN 3–36 MONTHS-OLD
Low risk infants
If child appears well (normal respiratory effort, tone, and capillary refill), no diagnostic
tests or antibiotics are necessary; Tylenol (15mg/kg) and/or Ibuprofen (10mg/kg) may
be given PRN fever; parents should be instructed to return if fever persists > 48 hours
or child's condition worsens
Consider
Urine testing: Catheterization specimen is best. See above (item I) for prevalence
and symptoms of UTI in children. Obtain urinalysis and culture (See Chapter
15, Urinary Tract Infections in Children for indications for further testing after
diagnosis of UTI). Culture should be done as up to 15% have UTI but no pyuria
or nitrites
Stool culture if blood or mucus in stool or ≥5 WBCs/hpf in stool
Chest x-ray if dyspnea, tachypnea, rales, or decreased breath sounds are present
Consider presence of influenza with rapid influenza testing
Antibiotics/antivirals: Consider based on concern for UTI, pneumonia, or viral
etiology
If child has an obvious viral infection, incidence of bacteremia is 0.2% and no
further evaluation is necessary
If child has been immunized against pneumococcus (vaccine was introduced in
the U.S. in 2000), many would not pursue further evaluation in a well, interactive,
active child
If child has not been immunized against pneumococcus, extra caution and close
follow-up are necessary
High risk infants: Evaluate in emergency department with full sepsis work-up
CLINICAL PEARLS
Risk of bacteremia rises as temperature rises, T > 105.6º F (40.9º C) is about 3 times more
likely to harbor bacteremia than infant or child with T of 102.2º F (39º C)

PEDS
For all febrile neonates < 28 days, a lumbar puncture is recommended. A lumbar puncture
is not needed unless neurologic signs are present for febrile children 3 to 36 months
In febrile children older than 28 days, a chest x-ray is indicated if WBC > 20,000/mm3 or
by clinical symptoms
CRP and procalcitonin may be useful for identification of serious bacterial infection
Urinalysis and urine culture are recommended for all febrile infants 24 months or younger
with unexplained fever
Follow-up remains very important; clinical course remains the most sensitive indicator of
serious illness
