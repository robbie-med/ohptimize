83. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
DEFINITION: A chronic, systemic inflammatory connective tissue disease characterized by
symmetric, erosive synovitis and sometimes multisystem involvement. Etiology is unknown.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Estimated prevalence of 1% of U.S. population
Prevalence increases with age
Twice as common in female patients
Much higher concordance in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins, suggesting
genetic predisposition; also, higher incidence with certain HLA subtypes (DR4 and DR1)
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Insidious development of symptoms over several weeks or longer
Symmetric inflammation of smaller peripheral joints, especially MCP, PIP, and MTP
joints, but may also affect large joints, particularly later in the disease. Involvement of DIP
joints is more typical of osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthritis
Morning stiffness often lasting more than an hour
Joint deformity: Caused by laxity of ligaments and tendons around the joints
Swan-neck: Flexion of PIP and hyperextension at DIP joints
Ulnar deviation of MCP joints
Atlantoaxial subluxation of cervical spine: May cause myelopathy or even death
(especially if in car accident or other trauma with subluxation)
Joint destruction: Often not apparent on x-ray until 1 year after onset of disease; initially
osteopenia followed by erosion of bone and decalcification
Rheumatoid nodules: Occur over pressure points and may be confused with tophi
Sjögren’s syndrome: May occur secondarily, especially in older patients with long-
standing disease
Anemia: Often have mild normochromic, normocytic anemia
Other: May also have vasculitis, pulmonary manifestations, nerve entrapment syndromes
(e.g., carpal tunnel), low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, and weight loss
DIAGNOSIS
Rheumatoid Factor: Nonspecific but present in up to 90% of patients with RA, usually
associated with more severe, erosive disease
Inflammatory markers: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein
(CRP) elevated but very nonspecific, however, may be used to clinically follow disease
with changes in treatment
Synovial fluid analysis: WBC count typically 1,500–25,000 with 60–75% PMNs, low
glucose, low C3 and C4 complement levels, and protein levels approaching those in serum
Diagnosis: Based on American College of Rheumatology Criteria

MANAGEMENT
Goals
Relief of symptoms
Preservation of function
Prevention of structural damage and deformity
Maintenance of patient’s lifestyle
Education: Explain goals of therapy and chronic disease course to patients; enroll help of
family members and other support groups
Physical and occupational therapy
Systemic rest: Depends on the severity of disease (e.g., mild disease may require only 2
hours of rest per day)
Articular rest: Relaxation and stretching of the hip and knee muscles to prevent contractures
Exercise: To preserve joint motion, and enhance muscular strength and endurance
Assistive devices: Raised toilet seat, gripping bar, cane, crutches, etc. (See Chapter 111
Falls in the Elderly)
Weight loss: Will aid with arthritis of the lower extremities
Nutritional and dietary counseling
Smoking cessation and lipid control to reduce cardiovascular disease
Immunizations to decrease risk of infectious complications of immunosuppressive
therapies
Local therapies
Heat and cold: For analgesic effects (heat or cold) and muscle-relaxing effects (prior to
exercising or stretching—local moist heat or warm tub baths)
Injections of corticosteroids (See Chapter 93, Corticosteroid Injection of Joints)
Splints: To provide joint rest, reduce pain, prevent contracture. Should be applied
for the shortest period of time possible and should be removed at least twice per
day for stretching and range of motion exercises. May coordinate with physical or
occupational therapist
Medications
Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Do not modify disease progression
but may with pain control and reduced inflammation. Often used as bridging
medications for relief of pain until onset of action of DMARDs occur
Some patients may respond to or tolerate one NSAID better than another. Most
common side-effects are GI and renal toxicity. NSAIDs except COX-2 inhibitors
can interfere with platelet function and prolong bleeding time. In addition,
NSAIDs except Naproxen may increase thrombotic risk
Aspirin: Inexpensive; 650–975mg 4 ×/day. High dose aspirin may have more
GI toxicity than traditional NSAIDs; use enteric coated aspirin and consider
administering with a PPI. Nonacetylated salicylates have less GI toxicity than
aspirin
COX-2 inhibitors: Celecoxib (Celebrex) 100–200mg BID; use in patients at high
risk of GI toxicity such as elderly patients, history of GI bleeding or peptic ulcer
disease, high dose NSAID therapy, and those receiving anticoagulants or systemic
corticosteroids
GI prophylaxis with chronic NSAID use: Consider use of a proton pump inhibitor,
or H2 blocker, may reduce incidence of NSAID induced GI toxicity
Glucocorticoids
Oral corticosteroids: Use low dose (5–7.5mg/day prednisone or equivalent), short
course (< 3 months) for symptomatic relief until beneficial effects of DMARDs
become clinically apparent
Adverse effects of systemic steroids include osteoporosis, weight gain, fluid
retention, cataracts, GI toxicity, poor wound healing, hyperglycemia, hypertension,
adrenal suppression and increased risk of infection
For patients on chronic corticosteroids, consider adding a bisphosphonate to
prevent steroid-induced osteoporosis. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements should
be recommended

MUSC
Intra-articular injection of a steroid such as Triamcinolone (Kenalog) can relieve
joint pain with minimal adverse effects in a patient who does not have generalized
disease
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS)
Used to control symptoms and delay or possibly stop progression of the disease
Most DMARDs have a slow onset of action and require regular monitoring of
adverse effects
Pretreatment evaluation: CBC, serum creatinine, aminotransferases, ESR, CRP,
hepatitis B and C in patients without a known history of hepatitis, ophthalmologic
screening for hydroxychloroquine use, TB screening
The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends using a treat-to-
target strategy, regardless of disease activity level
Use DMARD monotherapy in patients with symptomatic early RA (disease
duration less than 6 months) who have low disease activity or moderate/high
disease activity with the absence of poor prognostic features; and in patients
with established RA who have low disease activity without poor prognosis
and who have never taken a DMARD
Use DMARD combination therapy (including double and triple therapy) in
patients with early RA who have moderate/high disease plus poor prognostic
features, and in patients with established RA who have low disease activity
with poor prognosis or moderate/high disease activity, despite DMARD
monotherapy
Methotrexate (MTX) is usually the first DMARD of choice. Impact is usually
apparent within 4–6 weeks, but it may take longer. Contraindicated in women who
are contemplating pregnancy or who are pregnant, patients with liver disease or
excessive alcohol intake, and with eGFR < 30mL/minute
Leflunomide (Arava) can be used as initial monotherapy or in patients who do not
tolerate MTX
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is well tolerated and may be appropriate in milder
cases of RA. It is often used in combination with MTX and Sulfasalazine. It may
take 3–6 months to see its effect. Compatible with pregnancy
Minocycline may offer some benefit in milder cases of RA, but can cause drug-
induced lupus and is contraindicated in children < 8 years-old and pregnant
women
Sulfasalazine causes more toxicity than Hydroxychloroquine. Often used in
combination with HCQ and MTX as “triple therapy” regimen. Response rates of
triple therapy become similar to biologic DMARDs. Compatible with pregnancy.
Azathioprine (Imuran) is used less often as other options are more effective
with less side-effects. Most common side-effects when used for RA include GI
intolerance, bone marrow suppression, and infection
Gold has largely similar efficacy versus other DMARDs with greater risk of
toxicity. It has been used in combination with other nonbiologic DMARDs
with added clinical benefit without unexpected added toxicities. Mechanism is
unknown
Cyclosporine reduces T cell activation through the inhibition of calcineurin after
forming complexes in the cytoplasm. It is restricted to patients who have not
responded to conventional treatment. Nephrotoxicity is the most common adverse
effect and hypertension often occurs within the first few weeks of treatment
Biologic agents: TNF inhibitors and Non-TNF biologics
The American College of Rheumatology recommends
Use of a TNF inhibitor or non-TNF biologic with or without MTX in patients
with early RA who have high disease activity with poor prognostic features.
There are currently 5 TNF inhibitors: Adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab
(Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi) and infliximab
(Remicade). Golimumab and infliximab should be used in combination with
MTX

Add or switch to a biologic agent in patients with moderate or high disease
level after 3 months of inadequate response to DMARDs
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine present in the
synovium of patients with RA. TNF inhibitors relieve symptoms and are effective
in limiting joint destruction. They may be more effective than DMARDs and also
act faster than DMARDs. Use of TNF inhibitor in combination with MTX has
synergistic beneficial effects. TNF inhibitors are the first-line biologic therapy
and are the most studied. However, simultaneous use of more than one biologic
therapy is not recommended due to additive adverse effects
Patients who do not respond to one TNF inhibitor may respond to another
Common side-effects with TNF inhibitors include injection-site reactions,
infusion reactions and serious infections
TNF inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with hepatitis B, multiple
sclerosis or demyelinating disease
Non-TNF biologics
Abatacept (Orencia) is a genetically engineered fusion protein that interferes
with T-cell activation
Rituximab (Rituxan) is a genetically engineered chimeric monoclonal
antibody against CD20, a B-cell specific surface antigen. It is commonly given
concurrently with MTX or another DMARD
Tocilizumab (Actemra) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
competitively inhibits the binding of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-6 to its receptors
Anakinra (Kineret) is a human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist. It is
considered the less effective biologic agent for RA and is not recommended
Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) is a Janus kinase inhibitor. It is currently the only oral
biologic agent that is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-
to-severe RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX.
It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with MTX or other
conventional DMARDs
Patients should be screened for latent TB (PPD or interferon-gamma blood test)
before initiation and annually during treatment with a biologic agent
Complete blood counts should be monitored regularly
All patients on biologic agents should receive a pneumococcal vaccine, annual
influenza vaccination, hepatitis B, HPV, and herpes zoster vaccination. They
should not receive live vaccines (Zostavax, MMR, varicella or intranasal
influenza) during treatment. If needed, live vaccines should be given at least one
month before initiating treatment
The average cost for a biologic agent is between $3000 to $5000 per month
ACR recommendations for choice of biologic agents with comorbidities
Hepatitis C: Etanercept
Hepatitis B (untreated or Child-Pugh class B or higher): Do not use any biologic
agent
Malignancy
Treated solid tumor or nonmelanoma skin cancer, > 5 years ago: Any biologic
agent
Treated solid tumor or nonmelanoma skin cancer, within the last 5 years:
Rituximab
Treated skin melanoma: Rituximab
Treated lymphoproliferative malignancy: Rituximab
Congestive heart failure (NYHA III/IV and EF ≤50%) : Do not use TNF inhibitors
CLINICAL PEARLS
Asking about length of morning stiffness, e.g., “How long does it take in the morning for
you to feel as good as you’ll be?” is a useful way of following the severity of the disease as
the duration of morning stiffness correlates with the degree of joint inflammation
381
MUSC
Since Methotrexate is teratogenic, male patients should wait 3 months after stopping
therapy, and female patients should wait at least 1 ovulatory cycle before attempting to
conceive
Anti-TNF therapy should be discontinued if serious infection occurs. Screen for latent TB
before therapy with anti-TNF agents
DMARDS do not have immediate analgesic effects
