29. ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING
INTRODUCTION
The main goal will be to exclude non-uterine causes of bleeding (mass), then to:
Differentiate between ovulatory (heavy regular bleeding) and non-ovulatory (heavy
irregular bleeding)
This chapter describes the data gathering aspects in sections II.–VI. and then management
by age in Sections VII.–X. (adolescents, reproductive age women, perimenopausal, post-
menopausal)
HISTORY
Usual menstrual pattern: Onset of menarche, frequency, volume (number of pads/
tampons soaked per day), duration
Duration, volume, frequency of abnormal bleeding
Previous therapy for abnormal bleeding
Sexual history: Recent sexual activity, post-coital bleeding, birth control, history of
sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Weight change, exercise, eating disorder, stress, trauma
Medications: Oral contraceptives, long-acting contraceptives (IUD, Depo-Provera,
NuvaRing, Nexplanon), hormonal replacement therapy, antiepileptics, antipsychotics,
anticoagulants
Past medical history: Fibroids, polyps, endometriosis, history of abnormal Pap smears,
PCOS, systemic diseases (thyroid, renal, hepatic, coagulopathies), uncontrolled diabetes,
radiation therapy
TERMINOLOGY
Menorrhagia: Prolonged (> 7 days) or heavy (> 80mL) uterine bleeding (pads/tampons
changed at > 3 hour intervals is normal)
Metrorrhagia: Uterine bleeding occurring at irregular intervals
Menometrorrhagia: Prolonged or heavy uterine bleeding occurring at irregular intervals
Polymenorrhea: Uterine bleeding occurring at regular intervals of < 21 days
Oligomenorrhea: Uterine bleeding occurring > 35 days
Amenorrhea: Absence of bleeding for at least 3 usual cycle lengths (See Chapter 30,
Amenorrhea)
PHYSICAL EXAM
General exam: Weight, signs of thyroid abnormalities or insulin resistance, surgical scars,
hirsutism, acne, ecchymosis, galactorrhea
Vaginal exam: Lesions, masses, discharge, atrophy
Pelvic exam: Cervical polyps, cervical dilation, cervical motion tenderness, uterine
enlargement, adnexal masses
DIAGNOSIS
Exclude non-uterine causes of bleeding: Pregnancy (intrauterine, ectopic, molar), vulva,
vagina, cervix, urethra (urethritis), bladder (UTI, cancer), bowel (hemorrhoids, IBD)
Differentiate between ovulatory and anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)
Ovulatory AUB
114
OB-GYN
Heavy and/or prolonged bleeding that is typically at regular intervals (although
menorrhagia or midcycle spotting may occur)
Characteristics of ovulatory cycles: Regular cycle length, presence of premenstrual
symptoms (pelvic pain, breast tenderness, mood changes, increased thin vaginal
discharge), mittelschmerz (unilateral pelvic pain with ovulation), biphasic
temperature curve
Causes: Anatomic structural abnormalities (endometrial polyps, fibroids,
adenomyosis, cervical neoplasia), bleeding disorder (von Willebrand’s disease,
platelet disorder, factor deficiency, leukemia), hypothyroidism, chronic liver or
renal disease, copper IUD
Anovulatory AUB
Anovulation leads to prolonged estrogen production unopposed by progesterone
(no progesterone surge). This results in excessive endometrial proliferation/
thickening, endometrial instability, and irregular (sometimes heavy) bleeding with
unpredictable cycle length and often spotting
Causes: adolescence, perimenopausal, pregnancy, polycystic ovarian syndrome,
thyroid disorder, medication effects, hyper prolactinoma, uncontrolled diabetes,
endometrial hyperplasia/cancer, cervical cancer, eating disorder, significant weight
changes, stress, excessive exercise
Polycystic ovarian syndrome: Endocrine disorder usually associated with
anovulation, menstrual disorders (irregular bleeding, amenorrhea), infertility,
insulin resistance, obesity, increased circulating androgens (acne, hirsutism).
Excessive androgens are converted to estrogen in peripheral tissues. Unopposed
estrogen state increases risk of endometrial hyperplasia/cancer
LABORATORY
Pregnancy test (urine testing is adequately sensitive and specific)
CBC, TSH, prolactin
Pap smear: If age 21 or older (colposcopy/biopsy needed for patients of all ages if lesion
found in pelvic exam)—See Chapter 28, Pap smears
Pelvic cultures (if sexually active): GC, Chlamydia, Trichomonas
Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT), vWF Ag/ristocetin cofactor if indicated
Consider LH, FSH, DHEA-S, free testosterone if PCOS is suspected
AUB IN ADOLESCENTS
General
Cycles are often anovulatory and irregular following menarche (up to 80% in the first
year after menarche)
Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is usually mature within 18 months of menarche
Pelvic exam: Not necessary if within 18 months of menarche and not sexually active
Management
Mild-moderate bleeding: Cycle patients for 6 months on either combined oral
contraceptives (COC) or cyclic progestins (See Section VIII.B.3 below)
Severe bleeding: Consider further work-up for possible underlying coagulopathy
AUB IN REPRODUCTIVE AGE WOMEN
Ovulatory AUB
Assess for structural abnormality with transvaginal ultrasound or saline infusion
sonohysterography
Note: Measuring endometrial thickness in premenopausal women with AUB is not
helpful
Structural causes: Hormonal therapy may be attempted, but patient may need definitive
therapy (D&C, ablation, embolization, surgery)
Anovulatory AUB
Endometrial biopsy
115
OB-GYN
Women over age 35 with suspected anovulatory bleeding to rule out endometrial
hyperplasia/cancer
Consider in women age 18–35 with risk factors for endometrial cancer (chronic
anovulation; obesity; diabetes; family history of ovarian, endometrial, breast, or
colon cancer; tamoxifen use, estrogen therapy)
Treat underlying conditions if applicable
Hormonal therapy
Combined oral contraceptives (< 35mcg Ethinyl Estradiol): Natazia, a 4-phasic
COC (Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest), has recently received a new indication for
the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. It is the first and only medication with
such an indication
Levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)
Micronized Progesterone (Prometrium) 400mg daily × first 12 days of the month
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (Provera) 10mg daily × first 10–12 days of the
month
Norethindrone Acetate (Aygestin) 5mg daily × 5–10 days during second half of
cycle)
Non-hormonal therapy
NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen)
Lysteda (Tranexamic Acid) 1300mg TID for up to 5 days during monthly
menstruation
AUB IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (AGE 40 TO MENOPAUSE)
Ovulatory AUB—Same as in reproductive women
Anovulatory AUB
Can be a physiologic response to declining ovarian function in a perimenopausal
woman, but endometrial biopsy is needed to rule out hyperplasia/cancer
If normal, can prescribe hormonal therapy as described above
Use of oral contraceptives that contain estrogen is contraindicated in smokers age 35
and older
Diagnosis of anovulatory AUB vs. menopause
If patient has 3 consecutive months of amenorrhea, determine if she is in menopause
Obtain FSH level
If FSH is high (> 40 IU/mL), then patient is likely in menopause (although
officially diagnosed after 12 months of amenorrhea in absence of other
biological or physiological causes)
If FSH is > 25 IU/mL, patient is likely in perimenopause, especially if
accompanied by hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood symptoms, or vaginal
dryness
If FSH is low, the patient has AUB. Perform endometrial biopsy to exclude
malignancy
Can cycle with Provera 10mg daily × 7 days or low dose (20mcg) oral
contraceptives to see if patient has withdrawal bleeding
aa. If no withdrawal bleeding, then repeat in 3 months. If still no withdrawal
bleeding, assume she is in menopause
bb. If there is withdrawal bleeding, then patient is not in menopause. Continue
work-up for sources of AUB
Management
Provera: 10mg daily × 10 days—OR—
Prometrium 400mg PO BID × 10 days
Oral contraceptives: Use 20mcg pills
AUB IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN
Perform endometrial biopsy as initial test to evaluate endometrium. 5–10% are found to
have endometrial thickness. Can consider transvaginal ultrasound as alternative initial test
to measure endometrial thickness
116
OB-GYN
Results of endometrial biopsy
Hyperplastic without atypia: Treat with Provera 10mg daily for 14 days per month
or daily Megace 40mg or Mirena IUD. Repeat biopsy in 3–6 months. Refer to
gynecologist if hyperplasia persists
Hyperplasia with atypia: Refer to gynecologist. Patient likely needs hysteroscopy/
D&C. Associated with malignancy 15% of the time
Adenocarcinoma: Refer to gynecologist for TAH/BSO
Atrophic: Can begin HRT
Endometrial biopsy vs. transvaginal ultrasound
Meta-analysis showed that 96% of women with endometrial cancer and 92% of
those with endometrial disease had endometrial stripe thickness of > 5mm whether
or not they used HRT
If endometrial stripe on ultrasound > 5mm, endometrial sampling should be
performed
Biopsy is more unfavorable and may be difficult in patients with cervical stenosis
Cervical cytology also needs to be performed
Patients on HRT
30% of these patients will have uterine pathology
Women on continuous HRT may experience breakthrough bleeding due to missed
pills, medication interactions, or malabsorption. If bleeding occurs in 2 or more cycles,
further evaluation is indicated
On continuous HRT, up to 40% have irregular bleeding in first 4–6 months of therapy.
Most experts recommend evaluation of abnormal bleeding if it lasts > 6–9 months
after initiation of HRT
Management for women on HRT
If early withdrawal bleeding occurs, increase the progesterone dose
If intermenstrual bleeding occurs, increase the estrogen dose
If on continuous HRT, try cyclic
Try a different type of estrogen
CLINICAL PEARLS
All post-menopausal bleeding must be worked up as 7% of post-menopausal bleeding is
the result of malignancy!
Consider β-hCG in all pre-menopausal women with abnormal bleeding
