87. ANKLE INJURIES
ANATOMY
Ligaments of the lateral ankle
Anterior talofibular ligament
Prevents forward subluxation of the talus, also prevents inversion in plantar flexion
Most frequently injured ligament with inversion injury
Calcaneofibular ligament—prevents inversion in neutral position
Posterior talofibular ligament—strongest lateral ligament and rarely injured; prevents
posterior displacement of the talus
Deltoid ligament: Ligament of the medial ankle
Broad ligament with superficial and deep fibers
Prevents eversion
Tibiofibular joint/syndesmosis: Fibrous joint composed of three ligaments connecting the
distal tibia and fibula called the syndesmosis (See syndesmosis squeeze test below)
Anterior tibiofibular ligament
Posterior tibiofibular ligament
Interosseous membrane
Superficial posterior compartment of the leg: The following muscles insert at the
calcaneus through the Achilles tendon
Gastrocnemius muscle
Soleus muscle
Plantaris muscle
HISTORY
General: Swelling, ecchymosis, abrasions, lacerations, paresthesias, pain at proximal tibia/fibula
Mechanism of injury
Presence or absence of “pop” felt or heard at the time of injury
Ability to bear weight immediately following injury
Mechanism of injury (amount of force; inversion, eversion, etc.)
Location of pain
Swelling or ecchymosis, abrasions or lacerations
Previous injury to either ankle
Type of employment and level of athlete
PHYSICAL EXAM: Patients with acute ankle injuries will most likely have loss of range of
motion (ROM) and decreased strength secondary to swelling and pain which may compromise
the exam (drawer tests, etc.). It may be helpful to reexamine after the swelling has decreased
and compare to contralateral side
Inspection for swelling and ecchymosis to help localize the site of the injury. Inspect the
unaffected side for comparison. Ecchymosis extending proximally from the ankle to the
leg may indicate a syndesmotic injury
Palpation: Gently palpate to find areas of greatest tenderness—start with examining
the areas of least suspected injury. Particularly observe for tenderness of the malleoli,
navicular, cuboid, proximal 5th metatarsal, anterior process of the calcaneus, deltoid
ligament, anterior talofibular ligament/calcaneofibular ligament, Achilles tendon, peroneal
tendons, and tibialis anterior tendon. Also palpate the proximal fibula to evaluate for a
possible Maisonneuve fracture
Range of motion: Average ROM 13–16° dorsiflexion and 31–44° plantar flexion

MUSC
Pulses: Dorsal pedis and posterior tibial
Neurologic: Check sensation (L4: Medial lower leg and medial foot; L5: dorsum of foot;
S1: lateral foot)
Ankle stress testing: To assess ankle instability
Anterior drawer test: To test for laxity or disruption of the anterior talofibular ligament
Method: Have patient sit or lie flat with the legs unweighted. Stabilize lower leg
with one hand and the heel with the other hand and then, with the ankle in slight
plantar flexion, apply anterior force to the calcaneus to displace the talus forward
Results: Displacement of 8–10mm is noted with division of the anterior talofibular
ligament, and 10–15mm displacement is noted with tearing of anterior and
posterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament
Talar tilt (inversion test): To test for laxity or disruption of the calcaneofibular ligament
Method: Have patient sit or lie flat with the legs unweighted. Place inversion stress
on the ankle
Results: Indicative of anterior talofibular ligament disruption if 10–20° of
inversion is noted. If talar tilt greater than 20° then calcaneofibular ligament may
also be torn
Syndesmosis squeeze
Method: 10cm above the lateral malleolus, compress the proximal fibula against
the tibia
Results: If the patient reports localized pain at the distal tibia and fibula during
the syndesmosis squeeze, this may be indicative of a fibular fracture, interosseus
membrane disruption or distal tibiofibular syndesmosis damage
Thompson test
Method: Have the patient lie prone with feet off the edge of the table. Compress
the mid-calf and observe for plantar flexion
Results: A positive test (no plantar flexion) helps to confirm the diagnosis of an
Achilles tendon rupture
EVALUATION
Plain x-ray: Not all ankle injuries necessitate obtaining radiographic films. The Ottawa
ankle rules apply to patients 18 or older and suggest that films be obtained
If the patient is unable to bear weight both initially and when examined
Bone tenderness at the posterior edge of the lower 6cm of the distal tibia or fibula,
proximal 5th metatarsal, or over the navicular bone
Ultrasound: Can be considered to detect tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendon tears, joint
effusions, intraarticular bodies, ganglion cysts, ligament tears, and plantar fasciitis
CT: To localize osteochondritis dissecans, loose bodies and subchondral cysts
MRI: To evaluate for stress fractures; occult fractures, syndesmotic injuries, osteochondral
lesions such as osteochondritis dissecans and talar dome fractures; visualization of
Achilles, peroneal and posterior tibial tendons
Technetium bone scan: To evaluate for stress fractures, infections or degenerative arthritis
MANAGEMENT OF ANKLE SPRAINS
Incidence: 85% are lateral sprains, typically involving the anterior talofibular ligament,
10% are syndesmotic sprains, and 5% are medial sprains involving the deltoid ligament
Grade severity of ankle sprain: Sensitivity and specificity of the physical exam are
optimal 4–5 days post-injury

Management of Grade I and II sprains
Functional treatment
Support to prevent eversion and inversion with air stirrup brace, elastic
compression or laceup support
Early weight bearing
Early range of motion (ankle pumps, drawing alphabet)
Physical therapy
RICE and medications (See below)
Management of Grade III sprains
Non-weight bearing initially
Immobilization
Plaster posterior splint
Sugar-tong splint
Orthopedic evaluation
RICE and medications (See below)
RICE
Rest: Encourage weight bearing as tolerated; use crutches if needed
Ice: 20 minutes every 2–3 hours for 3–5 days or until edema and inflammation have
subsided; better pain control if initiated immediately after injury
Compression: Elastic wrap from distal foot to mid-calf will support ankle and decrease
edema
Elevation: Elevate foot to 15–25 cm above level of heart
Medications
NSAIDs: May be used to improve pain and swelling but consider side-effects of both
short-term and long-term use and comorbidities (GI, renal)
Acetaminophen: also may be combined with low dose NSAIDs to enhance analgesic
effect
Opiate pain medication: Use minimum quantity necessary for short duration
Tramadol (Ultram)
Rehabilitation
Range of Motion
Achilles tendon stretching
Alphabet exercises: Moving the ankle in multiple planes by drawing the letters of
the alphabet
Muscle strengthening exercises: Start once full ROM obtained
Start with isometric exercises and progress to dynamic exercises
Perform in all 4 directions of ankle movement
Proprioception: Start once the patient can bear weight without pain. May involve toe
raises with eyes closed or the use of devices such a wobble boards
Activity specific training: Graded progression to full activities which should be
supervised by a therapist or trainer. The use of lace-up ankle brace or athletic tape
is useful early in the return to activities. Follow-up exams to assess ligamentous
instability recommended
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF THE NON-HEALING ANKLE INJURY
Incomplete rehabilitation
Chronic instability
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)
Peroneal tendon pathology

Fractures (talar dome, 5th metatarsal, navicular, growth plate)
Anterior impingement
Neuroma
Accessory navicular bone
Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)
Lisfranc injury (tarso-metatarsal articulation of the foot)
CLINICAL PEARLS
Prolonged immobilization may lead to slowed return to normal function
If an ankle injury is not allowed to adequately heal and the ligaments are not allowed to
adequately tighten, patients may be left with a “loose ankle,” predisposing them to future
ankle strains
The typical mechanism of injury of a lateral ankle sprain is by inversion, which frequently
occurs with some degree of plantar flexion
Ecchymosis extending proximally from the ankle to the lower leg may indicate a
tibiofibular syndesmotic injury. Syndesmotic sprains tend to require a more prolonged
recovery time
Tibiofibular syndesmosis is a commonly associated injury with injury to deltoid ligament
Osteochondral fractures of the talar dome are typically diagnosed 4–6 weeks after an ankle
“sprain” that does not heal
In studies of patients with ankle sprains, no difference was found in the number of patient
complaints or residual ankle stability between those who were casted and those who were not
