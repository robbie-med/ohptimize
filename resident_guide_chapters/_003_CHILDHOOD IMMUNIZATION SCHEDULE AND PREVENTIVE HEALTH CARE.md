AND PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE
CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE
PREVENTIVE PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE RECOMMENDATIONS
FLUORIDE RECOMMENDATIONS
Daily fluoride supplements are recommended if drinking water is not fluoridated
Monitor intake of fluoride in children younger than 6 years of age because overuse
can result in enamel fluorosis. Use pea-size amount of fluoride toothpaste in children
less than 6 years. Brushing with fluoride toothpaste should be limited to twice a day and
should be supervised to limit swallowing. Supplements are appropriate for children at
high-risk for tooth decay (limited parental education, abuse or neglect victims, those not
receiving regular dental care, consumption of high quantities of sugars, use of orthodontic
appliances)
LEAD-SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS
Strong association exists between blood lead levels and intellectual function in children
Primary prevention: Anticipatory guidance for parents regarding minimizing exposure to
lead-based paint chips, dust, soil. Discuss importance of dietary iron to prevent absorption
of environmental lead
Secondary prevention: Begin at 9–12 months, consider again at 24 months
Targeted screening for at-risk communities and through risk-assessment
questionnaires:
Does your child live in or regularly visit a house or child-care facility built before
1950?
Does your child live in or visit a house or child-care facility built before 1978 that
is being or has recently been renovated or remodeled?
Does your child have a sibling or playmate who has or did have lead poisoning?
Other populations in which to consider screening: Immigrants from countries with
high levels of lead poisoning, iron-deficiency anemia, developmental delay +/- pica,
abuse or neglect victims, parental exposure to lead at work, low-income families
receiving government assistance
Screening: Venous samples preferable, but finger stick okay if collected correctly
Elevated Blood Lead Levels (BLL): Always obtain confirmatory sample!
BLL > 5 is now considered abnormal, education is appropriate

PEDS
BLL 10–14mcg/dL: General education on reducing environmental lead exposure,
repeat BLL in 3 months
BLL 15–19mcg/dL: Careful environmental history, optimal nutrition including
iron and calcium supplementation, frequent small meals to decrease absorption of
lead, repeat BLL within 2 months
BLL > 20mcg/dL: Obtain confirmatory test within 1 week, thorough environ-
mental/nutritional assessment, probable referral to local health department, referral
to specialist in lead toxicity therapy/chelation therapy
BLL > 70mcg/dL: Hospitalize patient, chelation therapy
