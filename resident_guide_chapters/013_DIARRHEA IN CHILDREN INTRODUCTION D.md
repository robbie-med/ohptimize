13. DIARRHEA IN CHILDREN
INTRODUCTION
Definition: Three or more watery stools in 24 hours. Diarrhea may be acute (< 2 weeks) or
chronic
Diarrhea worldwide is responsible for 4–5 million deaths/year in children < age 5. In
US, acute gastroenteritis (AGE) historically accounts for 10% of hospital admissions of
children < age 5
ETIOLOGY: Viruses are responsible for the majority (75–90%) of cases, followed by
bacterial etiologies, and lastly parenteral illnesses
Viral: Rotavirus (35% of hospitalizations for acute diarrhea), Adenovirus, Norwalk virus,
Enterovirus
Bacterial: Aeromonas species, Vibrio cholerae, E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica,
Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni
Parasitic: Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia
Other: Formula intolerance, protein intolerance, carbohydrate intolerance, lactose
intolerance, post-infectious diarrhea secondary to lactose intolerance, overfeeding,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic nonspecific diarrhea of infancy, excessive fluid
intake, celiac disease, pancreatic disease, constipation with overflow diarrhea, functional
tumors, intestinal obstruction, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), laxative abuse
Non-GI causes: Sepsis, toxic ingestion, immunodeficiency, hyperthyroidism
Etiologies of acute diarrhea by age
Infant: Gastroenteritis (viral), systemic infection, antibiotic use, primary
disaccharidase deficiency and Hirschsprung toxic colitis
Child: Gastroenteritis, food poisoning, systemic infection, antibiotic use, toxic
ingestion, hyperthyroidism
Etiologies of chronic diarrhea by age
Infant: Postinfectious secondary lactase deficiency, cow’s milk intolerance, soy milk
intolerance, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, secretory tumors, familial villous atrophy,
and primary immune defects
Child: IBS, IBD, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, giardiasis, laxative abuse
(adolescents), AIDS enteropathy, immune defects, secretory tumors, pseudo-
obstruction, and factitious diarrhea
HISTORY
Chief complaint and associated symptoms (vomiting, tenesmus, malaise/lethargy, fever,
weight loss, abdominal pain)
Frequency and character of stool (blood, pus, watery, foamy)
Onset and duration of illness
Dietary history (e.g., poorly cooked meat), well water vs. city water
Hydration status: Urine output, tears with cry, ability to take PO fluids/food
Travel history and exposures (day care center, sibling with diarrhea, etc.)
Developmental history
Medications, past medical history, family history (IBD, IBS, etc.)
PHYSICAL EXAM
A. General: Fever, irritability, height, weight, growth charts, mental status
B. Hydration status: Tears with cry, capillary refill, dry mucous membranes
C. GI/GU: Blood or pus in stool, vomiting, urine output

D. Skin: Rash, skin turgor

MANAGEMENT
Principles of appropriate treatment for INFANTS AND TODDLERS with diarrhea and
dehydration
◦Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) such as Pedialyte® (Abbott Laboratories)* or Gastrolyte® (Aventis
Pharmaceuticals)* or similar commercially available solutions containing appropriate amounts of sodium,
potassium and glucose should be used for rehydration whenever patient can drink the required volumes;
otherwise appropriate intravenous fluids may be used.
◦Oral rehydration should be taken by patient in small, frequent volumes (spoonfuls or small sips for toddlers;
small volumes in bottles for infants, paced to mimic sipping); see attached table for recommended volumes
and time period.
◦For rapid realimentation, an age-appropriate, unrestricted diet is recommended as soon as dehydration is
corrected
◦For breastfed infants, nursing should be continued
◦Additional ORS or other rehydration solutions should be administered for ongoing diarrheal losses
◦No routine laboratory tests or medications are recommended
▪However, if a patient is living in conditions that are crowded or otherwise conducive to outbreaks of
gastrointestinal disease, providers should consider testing for bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens
( www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks ).If an outbreak is suspected, testing a subset of patients may be
sufficient to confirm of the outbreak (e.g., 10 stool specimens for norovirus)
◦The decision to treat with antimicrobial therapy should be made on a patient-by-patient basis (www.cdc.
gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5304a1.htm). Even when a bacterial cause is suspected in an outpatient
setting, antimicrobial therapy is not usually indicated among children because most cases of acute diarrhea
are self-limited and their duration is not shortened by the use of antimicrobial agents. Exceptions to these
rules may involve:
▪Special needs of individual children (e.g., premature infants, children who are immune-compromised
or have underlying disorders)
▪Suspicion of sepsis
▪In the context of an outbreak of shigellosis, cryptosporidiosis, or giardiasis. Although hand hygiene
is the mainstay of prevention, antimicrobial treatment can eliminate carriage and help to control an
outbreak if rigorous hand hygiene measures are also observed.
◦Care-takers should be counseled in appropriate hand hygiene practices
• Anti-emetic medications and antimotility agents should generally be avoided
(See additional CDC chart on next page)

CLINICAL PEARLS
In the U.S., children less than 5 years-old have 1.3–2.3 episodes of acute diarrhea every
year
Rotavirus has an incubation period of 1–3 days. Vomiting may occur for up to 3 days, and
watery diarrhea for up to 8 days. May be accompanied by fever and URI signs
Adenovirus causes more prolonged diarrhea than rotavirus. Norwalk virus usually occurs
in epidemic outbreaks
Children who are dehydrated rarely refuse oral rehydration therapy (ORT), whereas those
not dehydrated will often refuse secondary to the salty taste of ORT
