84. GOUTY ARTHRITIS
DEFINITION
Gout
Inflammatory disease characterized by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals
Incidence (cases per 1000 person-years) is 1.4 for women and 4.0 for men. Incidence
increases with age, and women tend to be affected after menopause
Hyperuricemia: Defined as a level > 7.0mg/dL and resulting from either overproduction
or underexcretion of uric acid. Men are 6 times as likely as women to have a uric acid level
> 7mg/dL
ETIOLOGY
Primary gout
Underexcretion of uric acid (90% of patients): Primary idiopathic
Overproduction of uric acid (10% of patients)
Primary idiopathic
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency
Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase overactivity
Glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency
Secondary gout
Underexcretion of uric acid
Renal disease (chronic renal failure, renal insufficiency, lead nephropathy, poly-
cystic kidney disease)
Medications (ASA, diuretics, Niacin, Levodopa, Ethambutol)
Alcohol
Dehydration
Starvation/metabolic abnormalities
Other: HTN, obesity, hypothyroidism, Down syndrome
Overproduction of uric acid
Purine-rich diet (organ meats, sardines, anchovies, bacon, turkey, venison, veal,
scallops)
Alcohol
Obesity
Exercise
Other: Myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, hemolytic
disorders, psoriasis, chemotherapy
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Infectious arthritis, cellulitis, bursitis, tendonitis,
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout, amyloidosis, type IIa hyperlipidemia
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Differ depending on the stage
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
Serum uric acid level elevated (> 7.0mg/dL)
Vast majority of patient with hyperuricemia never develop symptoms
Acute gouty arthritis
Classic presentation: Acute, nocturnal onset of pain, swelling, warmth, and erythema
Monoarticular involvement is most common, with the first MTP joint affected in
50% of cases (podagra). Other joints affected include the forefoot, heel, ankle, wrist,
fingers, and elbow
Older adults, particularly women, may have a polyarticular presentation
383
MUSC
Fever and chills may be present in severe attacks
Peak intensity occurs within 24–36 hours
Resolution of symptoms without treatment occurs in days to weeks
Absence of symptoms between acute attacks (“interval gout”)
Interval gout
The asymptomatic period between acute attacks. May last weeks to years (50%
patients experience a second flare within 1 year of first)
Tophi (subcutaneous or interosseous collections of urate crystals) may be present in up
to 10% of patients if the disease has progressed to the chronic stage
Chronic tophaceous gout
Increasingly rare due to modern therapy (develops after > 10 years of acute
intermittent gout)
Locations include: Ear helix, proximal ulnar olecranon, Achilles tendon, and
prepatellar bursa
Acute exacerbations are frequent and often polyarticular
Morning stiffness and joint deformity (tophi) are common
EVALUATION
Joint aspiration
Identification of negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals under polarizing
microscopy remains the gold standard of diagnosis but is not routinely done in clinical
practice
If a septic joint is suspected, aspiration followed by culture and sensitivity is essential
The white blood cell count may also be elevated within the synovial fluid (10,000–
60,000) with neutrophils predominating
24-hour urine for uric acid
Important test to direct treatment and determine if patient is overproducer or
underexcretor of uric acid. Perform after acute attack resolves
Patients on normal diet with 24 hour uric acid excretion > 800mg are classified
as overproducers. Value of < 600mg classifies patient as underexcretor and > 800
suggests overproduction
Other labs
Serum uric acid: Not required for diagnosis (normal in 10% of patients). Useful in
monitoring response to urate-lowering therapy
Creatinine, CBC, LFTs, lipid profile, and UA
Imaging
Plain radiographs are not useful in diagnosing acute gout. Usually only soft tissue
swelling is seen
Classic radiographic findings in chronic gout: “Punched-out” bony lesions, cortical
erosions with overhanging margins, and joint space preservation
In general, gout must be inadequately treated for approximately 12 years before x-ray
changes are seen
MANAGEMENT
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
No medical treatment is indicated
Secondary causes of hyperuricemia should be sought and adjusted accordingly
Weight loss
Reduction in dietary purines
Reduction in alcohol consumption
Avoidance of dehydration, diuretics, and repetitive trauma
Control HTN and hyperlipidemia
Acute gouty arthritis
Treatment should be initiated as early as possible (preferably within 24 hours)
Immobilization and ice are important adjuncts to medical therapy
NSAIDs are first-line for acute attacks
384
MUSC
Full dose should be used until complete resolution of symptoms, though tapering
is optional in patients at risk of complications from NSAIDs. Examples
Ibuprofen: 600mg PO TID or 800mg PO 4 ×/day
Naproxen: 500mg PO BID
Indomethacin: 50mg PO TID
Systemic or local corticosteroids may be used depending on patient factors and
preference—Prednisone: 30–60mg/day, taper over 10–14 days
Adrenocorticotrophic hormone may also provide relief as second-line therapy
Urate lowering therapy (ULT): Patients on ULT should continue their regimen during
an acute attack. Initiating therapy during an acute attack could exacerbate symptoms
Chronic therapy
Chronic therapy is indicated in patients with tophi on exam or imaging studies, 2 or
more attacks per year and should be considered in patients with either CKD (stage 2 or
worse) or past urolithiasis (both level C evidence)
Includes anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and ULT to decrease the patient’s disease
burden
Diet modification is recommended for all patients initially
Avoid alcohol overuse (especially beer), organ meats and high fructose corn
syrup-sweetened foods and beverages
Limit alcohol, beef, lamb, pork, shell fish, sardines, sugar, fruit juices, sucrose
and sodium
Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is started as an acute attack subsides and/or ULT is
initiated and includes low dose Colchicine at 0.6mg once or twice daily or low dose
NSAIDs such as Naprosyn 250mg PO BID. Therapy should be continued until there is
no inflammatory activity and the uric acid lowering goal has been obtained
Colchicine dose must be adjusted in chronic kidney disease, age over 70, and
when used with high potency P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as
Clarithromycin, Erythromycin, Cyclosporine and Disulfiram
Urate-lowering therapy (ULT): Goal is a urate level at which there is no disease
activity, which is typically less than 6 but is often as low as < 5
ULT includes the Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) Allopurinol and Febuxostat
(Uloric), uricosuric agents such as Probenecid and the new biologic agent
Pegloticase
Allopurinol preferred over febuxostat due to cost and cardiovascular concerns
(ACR recommendations 2020),Allopurinol 1st line therapy for prevent of gout attacks
Can be started during an acute attack if there is concurrent anti-inflammatory
therapy to control symptoms
Monitoring (symptoms and urate levels) every 2–5 weeks initially then every 6
months once goal urate level is obtained
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI): Allopurinol (Febuxostat considered when
Allopurinol not tolerated)
Starting dose of 100mg/day (50mg/day in CKD stage 4 or worse). Higher
doses are more likely to precipitate an attack
Titration is every 2–5 weeks to reach goal as long as no signs of Allopurinol
hypersensitivity syndrome which has a mortality rate of 20% (AHS: Rash,
pruritus, LFT elevation). The final dose may be > 300mg/day, even in patients
with CKD (> 30mL/minute)
Treat-to-target goal of uric acid level < 6mg/dL
Uricosuric therapy: Probenecid, Losartan and Fenofibrate (the latter two are off-
label)
Typically prescribed as monotherapy when XOI are not tolerated or
contraindicated
Can be prescribed in combination with an XOI in order to reach therapeutic
goals
385
MUSC
Should not be used in patients with history of nephrolithiasis, elevated
baseline urinary uric acid and should not be first line therapy when CrCl is <
50mL/minute
Dilution (increased fluid intake) and alkalinization (with potassium citrate) of
urine should be considered to prevent stones
Pegloticase (Krystexxa): A novel IV administered biologic agent used in only
severe gout cases refractory to oral agents
CLINICAL PEARLS
Although hyperuricemia and gout are frequently associated, the two conditions are not
mutually exclusive—some patients with gout have normal uric acid levels, and some
patients with hyperuricemia never develop gout
Definitive diagnosis of gouty arthritis can only be made with joint aspiration with fluid
demonstrating characteristic MSU crystals
Any therapy for gout should include lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, low
purine diet, and reduction in alcohol consumption, as well as appropriate management of
comorbid conditions
If patients currently treated with Allopurinol or Probenecid experience an acute attack do
not adjust the doses. Treat with NSAIDs
If gout is present in patients < 30, consider a genetic disorder
