CLINICAL PEARLS
It is reassuring to inform parents what they can expect developmentally before the next
well-baby visit
Ask developmental milestones at each well visit
Screen thoroughly for appropriate development in gross motor, fine motor, language,
cognitive and behavioral domains with a tool such as Ages and States Questionnaires® at
selected visits, such as 9, 18, 24, 36 months
Screen for autism with a tool such as MCHAT ® between ages 18 and 30 months
If a child falls behind, refer to appropriate services (e.g., Physical, Occupational, or Speech
Therapy or Developmental Pediatrics), as early intervention has been shown to be more
effective in long term cognitive outcome and educational achievement.
