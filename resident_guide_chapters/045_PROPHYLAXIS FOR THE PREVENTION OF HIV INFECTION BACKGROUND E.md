45. PROPHYLAXIS FOR THE PREVENTION OF
HIV INFECTION
BACKGROUND
Epidemiology
Approximately 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and 40,000 people are newly
infected with HIV each year in the U.S.
Most new HIV cases are acquired through male-to-male sexual activity. Other means
of transmission include heterosexual sexual activity, IV drug abuse, breast milk, and
occupational exposure
Transmission
Body substances representing a substantial risk of HIV acquisition: Blood, semen,
vaginal secretions, rectal secretions, breast milk, or a body fluid that is contaminated
with blood
Body substances that have negligible risk of HIV acquisition: Urine, nasal secretions,
saliva, sweat, tears if not visibly contaminated with blood
Testing donated blood for HIV antibody began in 1985 in the U.S. Testing for HIV
RNA in addition to HIV antibody began in 1999. With current testing of donated
blood, the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection in the U.S. is about 1 in 1.5 to
2 million units of blood
PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) OF HIV INFECTION
(Based on 2017 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline)
Evaluation and Management of PrEP
Routinely taking sexual history is a necessary first step to identify which patients may
benefit from pre-exposure prophylactic medication
A pre-exposure prophylactic medication regimen can be prescribed to patients who are
at substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection and have no contraindications to starting
the medication
PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk
by up to 92%. 100% adherence is essential for PrEP to be effective
Note: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
with effective antiretroviral therapy to persons who are at high risk of HIV acquisition
(GRADE A Recommendation)
See the Table below for a step-wise summary of guidelines in determining substantial
risk and appropriate candidates for PrEP

Side-effects of PrEP
Some patient develop “start-up syndrome,” or side-effects of the medications
(headache, nausea, flatulence). These side-effects usually resolve within the first month
Can exacerbate HBV infection
Worsening renal impairment
Associated with a small decrease in bone mineral density (~1%) during first few
months, in several studies this decrease stabilized or returned to normal. Consider
osteoporosis risk in patient with history of pathologic or fragility fracture
Significant drug interactions with
Didanosine
HIV-I protease inhibitors, including atazanavir, ritonavir
Hepatitis C antiviral agents such as Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) or Harvoni
(ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)
Drugs affecting renal function: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir,
valganciclovir, adefovir, aminoglycoside, NSAIDs
Note: No significant interactions with Buprenorphine, Methadone, or OCPs

Discontinuing PrEP
Protection from HIV infection will wane over 7–10 days after ceasing daily PrEP use
Discuss alternative methods to reduce risk of HIV acquisition, including post-exposure
prophylaxis, and how to access it quickly if needed
Consistent condom use is associated with an 80% reduction in HIV acquisition
among heterosexual couples and a 70% reduction in men who have sex with men

POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) OF HIV INFECTION
Overview: Medication prophylaxis may be warranted for people who are exposed to HIV in
both occupational and non-occupational settings depending on the risk of the exposure to a
suspected positive HIV source (the “source patient”)
Occupational PEP
Definitions
Exposure: Percutaneous injury or contact of mucous membrane or non-intact skin with
blood, tissue or other body fluids that are potentially infectious
Transmission of HIV in an occupational setting
Fluids with infectious potential: Blood, vaginal or semen secretions, cerebrospinal
fluids, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic fluid
Fluids that represent non-infectious exposures: Feces, nasal secretions, saliva,
sputum, sweat, tears, urine, vomit (unless one of these materials appears bloody)
Factors that increase risk for HIV transmission
Exposure to larger amount of blood
A procedure involving placing a needle into an artery or vein
A deep injury
Management in occupational exposure to HIV
A person who is exposed to an infectious body fluid in the occupational setting
should be placed on a post-exposure prophylaxis regimen (PEP) of at least 3 anti-
retroviral medications for 4 weeks
Timing: PEP should be started as soon as possible after suspected exposure
(preferably within hours.) PEP is more effective when initiated within 72 hours
after exposure
Example of three-drug regimen for PEP: Emtricitabine, tenofovir, raltegravir. (The
combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir can be given together as Truvada)
Consult with specialist for selection and monitoring of anti-retroviral regimen
After suspected exposure, test the source patient for HIV if possible. (Do not delay
PEP while waiting for results)
Person receiving PEP should follow-up with a health care provider within 72
hours and at 2 weeks after starting treatment. This is an opportunity for the health
care provider to do the following
Answer questions
Re-assess indication for PEP
Ensure compliance
Manage medication side-effects
Assess for drug toxicity
Follow-up testing: Test exposed personnel for HIV seroconversion at 6 weeks, 12
weeks, and 6 months after exposure. Monitor for 12 months if source patient had
both HIV and hepatitis C co-infection
Management pearls
A source patient with a history of HIV but whose viral load is undetectable due to
treatment with anti-retrovirals could still transmit HIV and PEP should be offered
to people who are exposed
If the source patient is known to have drug-resistant HIV, consult with a specialist

to choose the regimen
Consult with a specialist if a pregnant woman has an occupational exposure
Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to PEP
HIV is a reportable disease, inform health department if patient becomes HIV
positive
Non-Occupational PEP (nPEP):
Indications: Consider PEP for non-occupational exposure when patient presents ≤
72 hours after exposure that poses substantial risk for HIV acquisition. (See A. 2, in
Prophylaxis for Occupational Exposure above for information on transmission risk)
Management of post-exposure prophylaxis
Step 1:
Determine risk. Substantial risk = patient exposed to body fluids know to be HIV positive.
Patient presents within 72 hours of exposure.
PEP is not indicated if patient presents >72 hours or if source fluid does not hold
substantial risk
Step 2:
Pre-treatment testing:
Test patient for HIV prior to prescribing PEP.
Test for other STIs: Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B/C
Obtain baseline SCr and eCrCl. (eCrCl should be ≥60mL/min to start preferred regimen
below.)
Pregnancy testing.
If possible, ask about the source patient’s recent viral load or use of anti-retroviral
treatment.
Step 3:
Prescribing PEP: 28-day three drug antiretroviral regimen. (for otherwise healthy non-
pregnant adolescent or adult patient.)*
Preferred regimen: daily Truvada (tenofovir 300mg + emtricitabine 200mg) plus
raltegravir 400mg BID**
Alternative regimen: Truvada plus darunavir 800mg daily plus ritonavir 100mg daily
Step 4:
Encourage behavioral interventions to reduce risk (condom use, limit high risk sexual
activity)
Step 5:
Consult with expert in Infectious Disease/ HIV if provider is unfamiliar with antiretroviral
medications before prescribing PEP if consult is available immediately.
Step 6:
Follow-up: Conduct HIV testing and any other STI/laboratory testing necessary.
Encourage medication adherence. Monitor for side-effects. Counsel on behavioral
modifications.
*Prescribing the entire 28-day course has been shown to increase the likelihood of adherence to the medication.
**There have been no randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of non-occupational PEP due to ethical
challenges such a study would present. Studies that have been done to evaluate the efficacy of non-occupational PEP
are often limited by loss of follow-up.

a Factors that may increase the risk of HIV transmission include sexually transmitted diseases, acute
and late-stage HIV infection, and high viral load. Factors that may decrease the risk include condom
use, male circumcision, antiretroviral treatment, and preexposure prophylaxis. None of these factors
are accounted for in the estimates presented in the table.
b HIV transmission through these exposure routes is technically possible but unlikely and not well
documented.
