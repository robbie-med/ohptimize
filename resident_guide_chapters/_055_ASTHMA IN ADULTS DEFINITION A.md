55. ASTHMA IN ADULTS
DEFINITION
Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways which is diagnosed by the presence
of characteristic symptoms in concert with variable airflow limitation on pulmonary
function testing. Obstruction is due to airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, and
bronchoconstriction
EPIDEMIOLOGY
More than 75% of patients with asthma are diagnosed before the age of 12
Asthma is chronic and changes over time
Impacts 7.4% of the adult population in the U.S. and continues to grow, resulting in 1.5
million ED visits and about 4,000 deaths per year
Asthma-related costs in the U.S. is about $3,300 per person each year
Asthma may be precipitated by environmental exposures (e.g., cigarette smoke, air
pollution, household pet dander, and pests such as cockroaches or dust mites) which may
be more prevalent in certain communities
HISTORY
Symptoms: Wheezing (may not be present during severe exacerbation due to severe
airway restriction), cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness. While wheezing may not
may not be present in an exacerbation, cough may be only symptom
Duration/peak of symptoms: Exercise-induced asthma typically occurs 5 minutes after
activity onset, peaking within 10–15 minutes and then resolves after 30–60 minutes
compared to exertional dyspnea or deconditioning which occurs shortly after activity
initiation
Frequency of symptoms: How many days/week? How many nights/week? Per month?
Alleviating factors: Rest from activity (in the case of exercise-induced asthma),
medications tried in the past and response
Exacerbating factors: Cigarette smoke, strong fragrances or perfumes, pet dander,
pollens, viral URIs, household pests including dust mites or cockroaches, air pollution,
exercise, changes in weather or humidity
Associated medical conditions: Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, Aspirin/NSAID
allergy
Family history: Atopic conditions including asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Pulse, respiratory rate, temperature
ENT: Nasal mucosa swelling, increased nasal secretions, nasal polyps, vocal wheezing
Respiratory: Tachypnea, retractions, wheezing (may elicit by having patient perform a
forced expiration), hyperexpansion of thorax, rhonchi
Skin: Eczema

GEN
Upper airway disorders: Vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction, foreign body aspiration,
upper airway mass, tracheal narrowing, tracheomalacia, angioedema
Lower airway disorders: COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia,
bronchiolitis obliterans
Systemic vascular disorders: Churg-Strauss syndrome
Psychiatric disorders: Conversion disorder, emotional laryngeal wheezing
DIAGNOSIS
History of episodic symptoms of airway obstruction including wheezing, shortness of
breath, tightness in chest, or cough
Reversibility of airway obstruction
Spirometry
Performed before and after inhaled bronchodilator therapy
Establish obstruction: FEV1 < 80% predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio < 65% predicted
Establish reversibility: FEV1 increases > 12% or 200mL after use of a short-acting
inhaled β-agonist
If exercise-induced asthma is suspected, consider performing exercise challenge
testing
Peak expiratory flow meters: There is variability depending on which is used, but
good correlation to follow and assess the severity of symptoms. 20% variability from
morning to afternoon suggests asthma
Radiography
Chest x-ray should be performed in adults with new diagnosis of asthma due to wide
variety of mimicking conditions
Chest CT is unnecessary for diagnosis
MANAGEMENT
GINA recommendations: Previous strategies for asthma management recommended
step-up therapy beginning with as needed short acting β-agonist (SABA) therapy for mild
intermittent asthma. A significant change to practice recommendations was published,
however, in 2022 by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Also note that GINA
published a 2022 report available at https://ginasthma.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/
GINA-Main-Report-2022-FINAL-22-05-03-WMS.pdf. Key updates include the following
SABA should not be prescribed as sole therapy as short-acting medications increase
the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Adding an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
daily or as needed reduces this risk
Patients should use the lowest dose of ICS tolerated and should attempt to reduce the
corticosteroid dose after symptoms are controlled
Clinicians should check inhaler adherence and modifiable risk factors (smoking,
allergen exposure, GERD, etc.) before considering a step up in treatment
Step down therapy should be considered if asthma has been controlled for 3 months
Step 1 therapy
Indication: Patients with symptoms less than twice per month AND no risk factors for
exacerbations
Treatment: Inhaled low-dose ICS/LABA combination used as needed
LABA monotherapy should not be prescribed due to risk of exacerbation
Alternative options: If ICS/LABA combination therapy is not available or affordable,
low-dose ICS as needed + SABA is recommended
Step 2 therapy
Indication: Patients with symptoms or rescue inhaler use twice per week or more
Treatment: Daily low-dose ICS + SABA as needed OR low-dose ICS/LABA as needed
Alternative options: Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but could
be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use ICS or who have
concomitant allergic rhinitis
Step 3 therapy
Indication: Asthma symptoms most days or waking due to asthma once/week or more
235
GEN
Treatment: Low-dose ICS/LABA daily + SABA as needed OR low-dose ICS/LABA
both daily and as needed
Step 4 therapy
Indication: Asthma symptoms every day and/or waking due to asthma several times
per week
Treatment: Low-dose ICS/LABA daily + as needed OR medium-dose ICS/LABA
daily + SABA as needed
Alternative options: The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be
considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and sub-optimally controlled asthma even
with ICS therapy
Step 5 therapy
Referral for allergist and/or pulmonologist evaluation in addition to consideration of
the following treatments: high-dose ICS/LABA, tiotropium (Spiriva), azithromycin,
anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/5R, anti-interleukin-4R α, sputum-guided
treatment, bronchial thermoplasty, and low-dose oral corticosteroids
Dosages for long-term control medications
Key: DPI, dry powder inhaler; EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm; HFA,
hydrofluoroalkane; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; IgE, immunoglobulin E; MDI, metered-dose
inhaler; NA, not available (either not approved, no data available, or safety and efficacy not
established for this age group); SABA, short-acting β2-agonist
*Note: Dosages are provided for those products that have been approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration or have sufficient clinical trial safety and efficacy data in the
appropriate age ranges to support their use.

Management of Asthma Exacerbations: Home Treatment
MONITORING
Four factors to consider in long-term control of asthma
Severity of asthma
Control after therapy has been initiated
Impairment and impact on daily functioning
Risk for future asthma-related complications
Follow-up
Schedule visits at 2–6 week intervals in individuals who are just starting therapy or
who require step-up therapy to achieve optimum control
Schedule visits at 1–6 month intervals in individuals after control has been achieved
Consider scheduling visits at 3 month intervals if step-down therapy is anticipated
Use of spirometry
At the time of initial assessment
After treatment is initiated and symptoms have stabilized
During periods of progressive or prolonged loss of asthma control
At least every 1–2 years or more frequently depending on response to therapy
