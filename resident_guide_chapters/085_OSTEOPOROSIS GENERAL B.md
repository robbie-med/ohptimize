85. OSTEOPOROSIS
GENERAL
Bone mineral density (BMD) cut-offs (WHO definitions)
Normal: BMD T-score of greater than or equal to 1.0 standard deviation below the
mean
Osteopenia: BMD T-score of between 1.0 and 2.5 standard deviations below the mean
Osteoporosis: Bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of less than or equal to 2.5
standard deviations below the mean at the total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine
(posterior-anterior)
Low impact (fragility) fracture: Fractures that occur following a fall from standing
height or less, or with no trauma
Osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder and affects more than 10 million people
in the U.S., 80% of whom are postmenopausal women
Accounts for greater than 2 million fractures annually at a cost of $17 billion to the U.S.
health care system. More women have osteoporotic fractures than new strokes, MIs, and
invasive breast cancer combined
Hip fractures are associated with more than 30% mortality in men and 17% mortality in
women in the first year with nearly 50% having some long-term loss of mobility
Categorized as primary or secondary
Primary Osteoporosis: Bone loss that occurs with aging
Secondary Osteoporosis: Secondary to medical disorders, hematologic disorders,
hypogonadal states, and certain medications that adversely affect bone health and
contribute to and/or exacerbate osteoporosis
Risk factors
Clinical risk factors: Low peak bone mass, advancing age (> 60 years-old), thinness
(weight less than 127lbs or BMI of < 20), Caucasian or Asian race, prior fragility
fracture, early menopause, hypogonadism, family history of osteoporotic fracture,
osteopenia on radiograph, systemic glucocorticoid use (> 5mg/day prednisone
equivalent for greater than 3 months), secondary causes of osteoporosis (See Table at
the above link)
Lifestyle factors: Cigarette smoking, low level of physical activity, prolonged
immobilization, heavy alcohol consumption (> 3 drinks per day), excessive caffeine
intake, propensity to fall
Nutritional factors: Low calcium or vitamin D intake, malabsorption syndromes
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
History: Evaluate patient for risk factors listed above, including age, sex, ethnicity, prior
fracture without major trauma (other than fingers, toes, and skull), early menopause, acute
or chronic back pain, history of falls, fainting, or LOC that may indicate increased risk of
falls, smoking or excessive alcohol intake and medication history for secondary causes of
osteoporosis. Also access family history of osteoporosis or fractures

Physical exam
Height: Loss of height of greater than 3cm increases likelihood of vertebral fracture
and should be evaluated with a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph
Weight: Weight less than 127lbs (57.6 kg) or BMI less than or equal to 20 is associated
with increased fracture risk
Kyphosis: Abnormal curvature of thoracic spine as a result of multi-level severe
vertebral compression fractures
Evaluate grip strength, visual acuity, gait stability and speed, balance, muscle strength
and coordination
Assess for features that may reveal secondary causes of osteoporosis
DIAGNOSIS
Bone mineral density (BMD): Used as a proxy for overall bone strength, which is
related to bone density and bone quality. BMD is the technical standard for diagnosing
osteoporosis
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning (DEXA, DXA): Gold standard for
measuring BMD
Advantages: High precision and accuracy, inexpensive, low radiation exposure (90%
less than standard chest radiograph)
Recommended Sites: Total hip, femoral neck, and posterior-anterior lumbar spine
Results
Score: Difference between an individual’s BMD and the mean BMD for a normal,
young adult population of the same gender. Score of +1 is 1 standard deviation
above the mean and -1 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. Osteoporosis is a
T-score less than -2.5
Z-score: Difference between an individual’s BMD and the BMD of others in a
population of same gender, age, and ethnicity
Only T-scores are used for diagnosis. But low Z-scores may suggest a secondary
cause of osteoporosis
BMD is the single best predictor of fracture risk
Peripheral sites: Distal radius and calcaneus. Less useful in predicting fracture risk and
therefore are not sufficient for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Cannot apply WHO
criteria to these sites, therefore use should be limited to when DEXA is not available
Other radiographic methods such as qualitative ultrasound or computed tomography
may assist in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, but they have not yet been accepted as sole
methods to be used for diagnosis or treatment determinations
Labs
Routine laboratory tests used to evaluate for secondary causes of osteoporosis:
CBC, CMP (serum calcium, serum albumin, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum
creatinine), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, TSH, and 24 hour urinary calcium excretion.
More extensive laboratory test may include serum phosphorus, PTH, ESR, CRP, total
and free testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, prolactin, tissue transglutaminase, 24 hour
urinary cortisol, and serum and urinary protein electrophoresis
Biochemical markers of bone turnover: Currently available markers include bone-
specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, the most useful markers presently. The
value of these markers in routine clinical practice has not been established, but is
likely to be in combination with other important risk factors, such as BMD
SCREENING: No controlled studies have evaluated the effect of screening on fractures or
fracture-related morbidity
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for routine screening
Women ages 65 and older (B recommendation)
Women ages 60 and older and at increased risk (B recommendation)
No recommendations regarding screening for women ages 60–64 without increased
risk for osteoporotic fractures (C recommendation)
388
MUSC
The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) also recommends screening younger
post-menopausal women who have had a fracture or who have one or more risk factors
identified, adults with a fragility fracture after age 50, adults with a condition or taking
a medication associated with bone loss, and men ≥70 years
North American Menopause Society recommendations for routine screening
Postmenopausal women with medical causes of bone loss, regardless of age
Postmenopausal women at least 65 years of age, regardless of additional risk factors
Consider screening for healthy postmenopausal women less than age 65 with the
following risk factors: Fracture (other than skull, facial bone, ankle, finger, and toe)
after menopause, history of hip fracture in a parent, current smokers, or low weight
(See II. B. 2.)
Number needed to screen: The USPSTF estimates that the number needed to screen to
prevent one hip fracture is 1,856 for women ages 60–64 and 143 for women ages 75–79
Screening frequency
Every 1–2 years: Any patient receiving treatment or approaching an intervention
threshold
Every 2 years: A T-score of -2.0 to -2.49 at any site or risk factors that may cause
ongoing bone loss
Every 3–5 years: A T-score of -1.5 to -1.99 at any site and no risk factors of ongoing
bone loss
Every 10–15 years: A T-score of -1.01 to -1.49 at any site and no risk factors of
ongoing bone loss
WHO Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX): Estimates the 10-year probability of a hip
fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture for an untreated woman or man. The algorithm is
available at www.nof.org as well as at www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX
OSTEOPOROSIS IN MEN
Epidemiology
1 to 2 million men in the U.S. have osteoporosis, and an additional 8 to 13 million
have osteopenia
13% of white men over 50 years will experience at least one osteoporotic fracture in
their lifetime
Risk factors
Low body weight (body mass index of less than 25kg per m2)
Weight loss of more than 10 percent of body weight
Physical inactivity
Corticosteroid use
Androgen deprivation therapy
Spinal cord injury
Screening
The USPSTF does not make any specific recommendations on osteoporosis screening
in men
The American College of Physicians proposes that physicians initiate periodic risk
assessment in older men before the age of 65 years; based on a meta-analysis, it
recommends dual-energy DEXA screening in men at increased risk of osteoporosis
who are candidates for drug therapy
Treatment: Similar to women. Note: Testosterone therapy increases BMD in men who
have low levels of testosterone
MANAGEMENT: All postmenopausal women should be counseled in non-pharmacologic
approaches to prevent bone loss and fractures. Pharmacologic therapy should be offered to
specific populations
Lifestyle modification
Nutrition: Balanced diet, adequate protein intake (daily protein supplementation of
0.8g/kg may shorten hospitalization in older patients following hip fracture)
389
MUSC
Calcium: Role in increasing BMD and improving efficacy of therapeutic agents. No
positive effect on fracture risk. Requirements of dietary calcium increase with age
Recommended daily calcium intake by The Institute of Medicine
Men 50–70 years-old: 1,000mg/day
Men > 71 years-old: 1,200mg/day
Women > 51 years-old: 1,200mg/day
Dietary calcium should be the primary source but supplemental calcium may be
needed when dietary intake is insufficient
The average calcium intake of an adult is about half of what is recommended
Calcium supplements
Calcium carbonate: Less expensive and necessitates use of fewer tablets. May
cause GI upset and have inadequate absorption in absence of gastric acid
Calcium citrate: More expensive and necessitates use of more tablets. Less GI
upset and no absorption dependence on gastric acid
Calcium absorption decreases at doses greater than 600mg, therefore
supplements should be divided between meals
Vitamin D: Essential for intestinal absorption of calcium. May decrease vertebral and
nonvertebral fractures. Sources: Sunlight, dairy products, fatty fish, and supplements
Daily recommendations: 800–1,000IU/day
Treatment of Vitamin D deficiency: 50,000IU Vitamin D2 or D3 daily) for 8–12
weeks followed by 1,500–2,000IU/day to maintain the target blood level of
25(OH)D ≥30ng/mL
Exercise: Impact and nonimpact exercises have a positive impact on the lumbar spine.
Impact exercise probably has a positive impact on the femoral neck. Strength training
has significant benefits on bone mass. Balance exercises have been shown to decrease
fall risk
Fall prevention: Focus on exercises to improve balance and muscle strength. Adjust
medications and reduce fall hazards in the home by improving lighting and removing
obstacles in the home, particularly in bathrooms, stairs and hallways
Smoking cessation: Recommended for all smokers
Alcohol avoidance: Postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis should not
consume > 3 drinks/day (1 drink = 120mL wine, 30mL liquor, or 260mL beer)
Pharmacologic management
Bisphosphonates
Mechanism: Inhibit the activity of osteoclasts, reducing bone resorption.
Significantly increase BMD in a dose-dependent fashion. Reduction of risk of
vertebral fractures by 40–50%
Indications: First-line therapy (except ibandronate) for prevention in
postmenopausal women with low BMD, treatment for postmenopausal women
with osteoporosis, prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid related bone loss,
first-line therapy in men with low BMD or osteoporosis
Contraindications: Patients with esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal
emptying. Patients who are unable to sit or stand upright for 30 to 60 minutes after
medication administration. Creatinine clearance less than 30mL/min
Side-effects: Dysphagia, esophagitis, esophageal and gastric ulcers, and flu-like
illness with large doses of IV bisphosphonates. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, primarily
seen after dental extraction and with large doses related to treatment of cancer-
related bone diseases
Dosing: Oral formulations
Daily, weekly, or monthly formulations of bisphosphonates are available
Bisphosphonate tablets must be taken on an empty stomach, first thing in the
morning, with 8 ounces of plain water
Dosing: IV formulations
Ibandronate (Boniva) 3mg IV bolus every 3 months is indicated only for the
treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis
390
MUSC
Zoledronic Acid (Reclast) 5mg IV infusion over at least 15 minutes once a
year for treatment and once every other year for prevention. Patients should
be well hydrated and pre-treated with acetaminophen to reduce the risk of an
acute phase reaction. Avoid use in patient with CrCl < 35mL/minute
Duration of treatment
Evidence of efficacy beyond 5 years is limited. Rare events such as
osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures are more common
beyond 5 years
Treatment duration should be individualized with a comprehensive risk
assessment. It is reasonable to discontinue bisphosphonates after 3–5 years
of oral use (or 3 years of IV administration) in people who have a low/
moderate risk of fracture. However, those who have a high risk for fracture,
continued treatment with a bisphosphonate or an alternative therapy should be
considered
Types of bisphosphates
Alendronate (Fosamax)
Administration: Oral
Dose: 10 mg 1 ×/day; 70mg 1 ×/week
Reduces incidence of: Vertebral fractures, hip fractures and nonvertebral
fractures

Dose: 5mg 1 ×/day; 35mg 1 ×/week or 150mg 1 ×/month
Administration: Oral, delayed-release (enteric-coated)
Dose: 35mg 1 ×/day
Reduces incidence of: Vertebral fractures, hip fractures and nonvertebral
fractures
Discontinuation: After 5 years (in select patients)
Based on indirect evidence
Monthly oral dosing
Zoledronic acid (Reclast, Aclasta)
Administration: Intravenous
Dose: 5mg 1 ×/12 months
Reduces incidence of: Vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and nonvertebral
fractures
Discontinuation: After 3 years (in select patients)
Intravenous with longest dosing interval
Ibandronate (Boniva, Bonviva)
Administration: Oral
Dose: 150mg 1 ×/month
Administration: Intravenous
Dose: 3mg 1 ×/3 months
Reduces incidence of: Vertebral fractures and possibly nonvertebral
fractures
Discontinuation: Limited information on it
Two dosing forms with long intervals
Raloxifene (Evista)
Mechanism: Selective estrogen receptor modulator with benefits on BMD, but
with a lower risk for breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease
when compared to estrogen. Reduction of risk of vertebral fractures
Indications: For prevention in postmenopausal women with low BMD, treatment
for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
Side-effects: Venous thromboembolic disease, pulmonary embolism, and hot
flashes
391
MUSC
Reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer
Dosing: 60mg/day oral formulation
Salmon Calcitonin (Miacalcin)
Mechanism: Reduction in bone resorption. Increases BMD and reduces lumbar
spine fractures
Indications: Often used to reduce acute bone pain from osteoporotic vertebral
compression fractures. Second-line therapy: Approved for treatment of
osteoporosis in women > 5 years after menopause when alternative treatments are
not suitable
Dosing: Nasally at 200IU/day. Also available as a subcutaneous injection
There are concerns about an increased risk of malignancies from Calcitonin.
Continued therapy should be evaluated on a regular basis. The FDA advisory
committee has recommended that Calcitonin no longer be used as a treatment for
osteoporosis. It has been removed from the market in Canada and Europe
Hormone therapy (HT)
Mechanism: Systemic estrogens promote preservation and increased BMD.
Reduction of fracture risk
The Woman’s Health Initiative (WHI) found that 5 years of HT reduced the risk
of clinical vertebral fractures and hip fractures by 34% and other osteoporotic
fractures by 23%. However, there was increased risks of MI, stroke, invasive
breast cancer, pulmonary emboli and DVT during 5 years of HT
The primary indication for HT is for women with moderate to severe menopausal
symptoms
Dosing: General rule = lowest dose for shortest duration
Conjugated estrogen/Bazedoxifene (Duavee)
It is a tissue-selective estrogen complex
Indicated for women who suffer from moderate-to-severe hot flashes associated
with menopause and to prevent osteoporosis after menopause
Dose: One 0.45mg/20mg tablet taken once daily
Side-effects: Muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain,
oropharyngeal pain, dizziness, and neck pain
Same boxed warning and precautions as other estrogen products
Teriparatide (Forteo)
Mechanism: Recombinant human parathyroid hormone that stimulates osteoblastic
bone formation. Reduction of vertebral fracture by 67%
Indications: Treatment of postmenopausal women who are at high risk for fracture
or for whom other therapies have failed

predispose to bone tumors such as Paget’s Disease or skeletal irradiation
Side-effects: Muscle cramps, hypercalcemia, nausea and dizziness
Recommended dose 20mcg/day subcutaneously for no longer than 18–24 months
Denosumab (Prolia)
A receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) ligand (RANKL) inhibitor

of fracture or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available
osteoporosis therapies
For bone loss in men with prostate cancer
For bone loss in women with breast cancer
Dose: 60mg SC once every 6 months, administered by a health provider
Side-effects: Hypocalcemia, increased risk of serious skin infections (cellulitis)
and skin rash, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, osteonecrosis of the jaw
and atypical femur fractures (rare)

CLINICAL PEARLS
Osteoporosis is diagnosed by a BMD T-score of less than or equal to 2.5 standard
deviations below the mean. DEXA is the gold standard for diagnosis
The USPSTF recommends screening women aged 65 and older and women aged 60 and
older and considered at increased risk with a DEXA scan
All postmenopausal women should be counseled in lifestyle modification to prevent bone
loss and fractures
Medications should be started for patients with a T-score -2.0 or lower by hip DEXA with
no risk factors, or those with T-score of -1.5 or lower and one or more risk factors
