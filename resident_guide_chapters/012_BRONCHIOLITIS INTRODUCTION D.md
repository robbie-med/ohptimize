12. BRONCHIOLITIS
INTRODUCTION
Definition:Acute lower respiratory infection which causes inflammation of the bronchi or
bronchioles, resulting in in distal airway obstruction
Age < 24 months
Occurs mostly in the winter and early spring
In all geographic locations
Most common cause of hospitalization among infants during the first 12 months of life
HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE DISEASE
Prematurity (< 36 weeks gestational age)
Low birth weight
< 12 weeks-old
Chronic pulmonary disease (particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD))
Anatomic airway defects
Congenital heart disease
Immunodeficiency
PRESENTATION
Signs and symptoms
Expiratory wheezing and inspiratory crackles
Temperature usually < 101º F
Sore throat, cough, and coryza
Grunting, intercostal retractions, dyspnea, tachypnea, prolonged expiratory phase
Episodes of restlessness or lethargy
Differential diagnosis
Asthma
Allergies (IgE-mediated hypersensitivity)
Foreign body aspiration
Pneumonia/aspiration PNA
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Vascular rings
Congestive heart failure (CHF)
Cystic Fibrosis
ETIOLOGY
Viral: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, human
metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus
Bacterial: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis
EVALUATION
History and physical exam
Diagnosis and assessment of severity of bronchiolitis
Radiographic and laboratory studies should not be obtained routinely
Chest x-ray (CXR)
Obtain on all “first-time wheezers” to rule out other potential diagnosis
Such as foreign body aspiration, pneumonia or CHF
Common radiologic findings associated with bronchiolitis
38
PEDS
Hyperinflation, flattening of the diaphragms
Peribronchial thickening
Atelectasis
Laboratory: Not typically used in outpatient practice
Can obtain arterial blood gas and serum electrolytes for concern of threatening
respiratory failure
MANAGEMENT
Usually, a self-limited illness that last for 3–4 weeks
Home management
Most patients can and should be treated at home with supportive care and anticipatory
guidance
Symptomatic relief
Anti-pyretics (Tylenol, Ibuprofen)
NOT recommended: Mucolytics, antitussives and nasal decongestants
Try saline nose drops to thin the mucus, followed by bulb suction to temporarily
remove nasal secretions
Bronchodilator therapy
Treatment is NOT routinely suggested for management of mild symptoms
In patients with severe symptoms, studies suggest that bronchodilators improve
clinical scores in the short term
Studies suggest that bronchodilators do not improve oxygen saturation or reduce
admission rates
May cause tachycardia, increased BP, decreased oxygen saturation, flushing,
hyperactivity, prolonged cough and tremors
Adequate hydration and nutrition
Avoid exposure to other children (incubation period of RSV is 4–6 days)
Avoid second-hand tobacco or smoke exposure
ED precautions for further evaluation if any of the follow occur: Respiratory distress,
lethargic behavior, poor feeding, signs of dehydration
Note: Steroids have NOT been shown to be beneficial in altering disease course
Criteria for inpatient management of bronchiolitis
Toxic appearing, poor feeding, lethargy, or dehydration
Increasing respiratory distress, tachypnea > 70 breaths per minute, cyanosis,
hypoxemia, or apnea
Marked intercostal, subcostal, or suprasternal retractions
Immunocompromised patients
Patients with a history of cardiopulmonary disease
PREVENTION
Palivizumab (Synagis) prophylaxis
Should not be administered to healthy infants > 29 weeks gestation or greater for
prophylactic purposes
May be given to infants and children < 24 months with BPD or history of prematurity
(< 35 weeks gestation)
15mg/kg/dose × 5 monthly doses beginning November or December (start of RSV
season)
Influenza vaccination for children > 6 months of age
Should encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months to decrease the morbidity
of respiratory infections
CLINICAL PEARLS
1 child in 50 will require hospitalization secondary to RSV bronchiolitis. Of these, 3–7%
develop respiratory failure and 1% will die
The mortality rate from nosocomial RSV in ill infants is as high as 20%
Children with non-severe bronchiolitis can be managed in the outpatient setting, unless
39
PEDS
there are concerns about the caregivers’ ability to care for them at home, and if so, advise
to go to the hospital
Antibiotics should be withheld unless a bacterial etiology is suspected
