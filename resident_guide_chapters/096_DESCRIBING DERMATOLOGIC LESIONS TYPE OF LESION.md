96. DESCRIBING DERMATOLOGIC LESIONS
TYPE OF LESION (See illustrations)
Macule: A circumscribed area of skin in which the color is different from the surrounding
skin. (Can differentiate from papule by oblique lighting). A macule is flat and may measure
up to 1cm
Patch: A flat area of color change > 1cm in size (basically a macule > 1cm)
Papule: A solid lesion, generally < 0.5cm in diameter, that is elevated above the plane of
the surrounding skin. Confluence of papules leads to plaque formation
Nodule: A palpable, solid, round or ellipsoidal lesion that is deeper than a papule and is in
the dermis or subcutaneous tissue (basically a large papule). These result from infiltrates,
neoplasms or metabolic deposits and are often indicators of systemic disease
Vesicle: A circumscribed, elevated fluid-containing lesion (blister) < 0.5cm, often
translucent
Bulla: A blister measuring greater than 0.5cm. Both bulla and vesicles are formed from a
cleavage at various levels of the skin, i.e., epidermal layers or dermal-epidermal interface
Pustule: Blister filled with pus
Plaque: An elevation above the skin surface that occupies a relatively large area in
comparison with its height above the skin
Wheal: An edematous pink papule or plaque that is characteristically evanescent,
disappearing within hours
Crusts: Dried serum, blood or exudate on the surface of the skin
Erosion: A break in the surface epithelium
Ulcer: A skin defect in which there has been loss of the epidermis and dermis. Describe
the location, borders, base, discharge and any topographic features
Comedones: A plugged pilosebaceous opening, open (blackhead) vs. closed (whitehead)
Burrow: A linear trail produced by parasites
Atrophy: Loss of substance in the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous tissue
Telangiectasia: A superficial dilatation of blood vessels
Purpura: Non-blanching red or violaceous lesions
Cyst: A cavity with a lining containing liquid or semisolid material
Scale: Superficial dead epidermal cells cast off from the skin
Fissure: Skin split extending into the dermis
Excoriation: Superficial skin erosion caused by scratching
Lichenification: Skin markings and thickening with induration secondary to chronic
inflammation caused by irritation (such as scratching or pressure point)
