21. PRENATAL CARE
SCHEDULE OF PRENATAL VISITS: Schedules vary by patient population and practitioner
Note: Pre-conception counseling: Ideally should be first visit. Patient should be given 400mcg
Folic Acid supplementation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Rubella immunity should
be checked and consideration of vaccination if not immune (patients should be counseled to
not become pregnant for 3 months after receiving immunization)
Every 4 weeks until 28 weeks
Every 2 weeks from 28–36 weeks
Every week from 36 weeks until delivery
Bi-weekly non stress tests if post-term. Consider modified biophysical profile for amniotic
fluid index (AFI) depending on risk factors
Consider induction in uncomplicated patient at 41 weeks
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Forms may vary by practice
History
Pregnancy: Date of first day of last menstrual period (LMP) and timing and flow
(normal or light) of LMP
Birth history: History of preterm labor, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/
preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, incompetent cervix, gestational age of previous
births, birth weights, type of anesthesia used, use of vacuum or forceps, episiotomy,
history of postpartum hemorrhage, history of shoulder dystocia
Past medical history
History of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), depression or postpartum
depression, history of varicella, and immunization history
History of chronic illness: As more women are delaying pregnancies, more chronic
medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, are seen in
older pregnant women
Past surgical history: Cesarean section (determine classical vs. low transverse and
obtain confirmation if possible), prior gynecological or cervical surgeries (e.g., loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP))
Medications
Assess chronic medications for fetal harm and stop medications which are no
longer needed
Caution with statins, non-SSRI antidepressants, anti-seizure medications,
immunosuppressants.
Continue asthma medications
Drug sensitivities/allergies
Family history including history of genetic abnormalities
Social history: Alcohol, tobacco and drug use, physical and/or emotional abuse
Family support systems, involvement of “father of the baby”
Diet and exercise, weight gain with past pregnancies
Patient preferences: Anesthesia/analgesia, breast vs. bottle feeding, postpartum
contraception, etc.
Physical exam: Perform a full physical including thyroid, breast and pelvic exams
Labs and other tests
Routine
Blood group type and Rh factor (this is essential if ectopic or SAB)
Indirect Coombs (antibodies to other blood group antigens)
Hepatitis surface antigen (chronic hepatitis B)
76
OB-GYN
H/H
Blood glucose
Rubella antibody titer
Syphilis serology at intake and repeat in third trimester
HIV: If first test is negative and patient has significant risk factors, then repeat in
3–6 months
Urinalysis and culture
Gonorrhea, Chlamydia cultures (DNA probe)
Pap smear if age > 21
If history of blood transfusions, check titers for Duffy and Kell antibodies. If
increased, then patient is a candidate for amniocentesis
Optional
Sickle cell (at-risk populations)
PPD (pregnancy mimics immunocompromised state): Consider in high-risk
patients
Ultrasound: Obtain if unsure of LMP or the LMP was abnormal. Not necessary if
EDC by dates is reliable
Toxo, CMV, varicella: Varicella zoster antibodies if patient has not been exposed
Vaccines
Influenza vaccine: Should be given to all pregnant women (no longer trimester
specific)
Varicella (Varivax): Should not be given to pregnant women. Women should avoid
pregnancy within 1 month of receiving the vaccine
Pertussis booster (Tdap: Adacel or Boostrix): Should be given during each pregnancy
irrespective of the patient’s prior history of receiving Tdap (ACIP, October 24, 2012)
Optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27–36 weeks gestation
Recommend family members and infant care givers to get booster as well
INITIAL VISIT TO 28 WEEK VISITS
History
Contractions: Frequency, intensity
Fetal movements (First felt at 18–20 weeks in primip, 16–18 weeks in multip)
Vaginal discharge or bleeding
Symptoms of preeclampsia (after 20 weeks)
Edema (distinguish ankle edema vs. hand/face edema—latter is more significant
for preeclampsia, particularly in third trimester)
Headache
Blurred vision
Abdominal pain (round ligament pain begins at approx. 20 weeks)
Alcohol or drug use
Compliance with prenatal vitamins
Physical exam
Blood pressure (should be below 140/90)
Weight gain: Based on body mass index
Underweight women: 28–40lbs desired
Normal weight women: 25–35lbs desired (5lbs in first 20 weeks, then 1lb/ week
through end of pregnancy)
Overweight women: 15–20lbs desired (need supervision and diet instruction)
Fetal heart tones: Heard by Doppler at 10–12 weeks
Fundal height (FH): Measure with bladder empty and legs extended, from the pubic
symphysis to top of uterine mass (full bladder can increase FH 3cm)
Urine dip (done in office at every visit): Check for protein, glucose, ketones and
leukocytes
Protein: “Trace” or 1+ is WNL. If 2+ or more, then check 24 hour urine for protein
77
OB-GYN
Glucose: “Trace” is normal with pregnancy due to increased glomerular filtration
rate (GFR). If risk factors or more than “trace,” then consider one 1 hour Glucola
screen.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria (incidence during pregnancy is 2–7%): Major cause of
maternal and fetal morbidity. If untreated, 25–30% may develop pyelonephritis
Diagnosis based upon isolation of > 105 organisms per mL of urine in
2 consecutive clean-catch specimens. E Coli is most common offending
organism
Give 5 day course of Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) or Amoxicillin and screen
with every month cultures. Macrobid should not be used if pyelonephritis is
suspected as it does not reach therapeutic levels in the kidneys
If greater than 1 UTI or more than 1 incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria:
Need prophylaxis for duration of pregnancy
Symptomatic bacteriuria. Treat with Cephalexin (Keflex). Fluoroquinolones
are contraindicated in pregnancy. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)
and Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) are not recommended after 36 weeks gestation.
Other options should be considered over Macrobid in the first trimester
Genetic screening: All women should be offered a blood test for neural tube defects and
trisomy 21 and 28 (See 2. Quad screen, below). Women at increased risk of aneuploidy
should be offered amniocentesis or CVS (See 5 and 6 below). Some offer fetal nuchal
translucency (NT) can be measured by ultrasonography combined with maternal serum
analyte levels (i.e., free hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A)
Women at increased risk of aneuploidy
Age > 35 at time of delivery (or age > 32 with twins)
Fetus with major structural anomaly identified by U.S.
U.S. markers of aneuploidy (e.g., increased nuchal thickness)
Previously affected pregnancy
Couples with translocation, chromosome inversion or aneuploidy
Positive maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screen
Quad screen
Indication: To screen pregnancies for neural tube defects (NTD) and Down
syndrome
Perform at 16–20 weeks
Quad analyte screen includes maternal serum α-fetoprotein, HCG unconjugated
estriol, and inhibin A. Detects 90% of anencephalic cases, 80% of spina bifida
cases, and 70% of Down syndrome cases
Risks for these anomalies are given as odds, e.g., 1 in 200 chance of having a
child with Down syndrome. The calculation is done by measuring the level of
each analyte, taking the age of the patient and comparing to other patients at same
gestational age
If a patient has an abnormal screen, the most likely reason is that the gestational
age is incorrect. The next step is to obtain an ultrasound to confirm dates and
repeat the calculation
Statistically 4–5% of all AFPs will be low
Down syndrome occurs in 1.3 of 1000 live births
Cell-free fetal DNA screening (Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis)
Indication: To screen pregnancies for chromosomal abnormalities, i.e., Trisomy (3,
18, 21). Can also determine sex of fetus
Performed by isolating fetal DNA from maternal blood sample. Can be done at 10
weeks gestation
Nuchal translucency (NT)
Indication: Screen for trisomy
Perform at 10–13 weeks
Sensitivity 70% for Down
Chorionic villus sampling
78
OB-GYN
Indication: To determine karyotype and genetic disorders in women with advanced
maternal age (> 35) or high risk for genetic abnormalities as above. Does not
screen for spina bifida
Perform at 10–12 weeks
Risk of fetal loss is 1–1.5%. May be associated with transverse limb defects in
0.1–0.3% undergoing the procedure
Amniocentesis: Recommended option of choice for age > 35
To test for chromosomal abnormalities including Down, Tay-Sachs, Sickle Cell
disease
Indications
Advanced maternal age (> 35) or women with high risk of genetic
abnormalities as above
Follow-up abnormal analyte screen
Perform at 15–20 weeks gestation
The chance of fetal trisomies at maternal age 35 is 1/200; age 45 is 1/20
There is a 1/200 risk of fetal loss from amniocentesis if performed with ultrasound
guidance
WEEKS 28–36
History: Same as above. Inquire about > 4 contractions/hour, vaginal bleeding, leaking,
fluid or UTI symptoms
Physical: Same as above
Other
1 hour post Glucola (1 hour PG): Done at 26–30 weeks
Consists of 50g glucose load
15% of population will be abnormal. 1–2% of pregnant mothers are diabetic
Normal is < 140. If > 140 then obtain 3 hour GTT
3 hour GTT is abnormal if 2 or more values are abnormal:
Fasting < 105
1 hour < 190
2 hours < 165
3 hours < 145
H/H: 28 weeks (get with 1 hour PG)
Syphilis serology is repeated at 28 weeks, regardless of first test result
Repeat GC/Chlamydia in high risk population or if patient was positive in first
trimester
If mother is Rh negative: RhoGAM 300mcg IM at 28–32 weeks. If “father of baby” is
Rh+, check indirect Coombs prior to giving RhoGAM
If desired, sign consent for tubal ligation/tubal referral
Counsel patient on fetal movement/kick graph. Should count 10 kicks/hour
Discuss birthing classes (Lamaze or patient’s preference)
WEEK 36–DELIVERY
History: Same as above
Physical exam: Same as above—plus—
Weekly cervical exams beginning at 37 weeks
Palpate abdomen for fetal lie and position
Labs: Group B strep screening per recommendations below
Discuss anesthesia during labor (Epidural, Nubain), episiotomy, and labor and delivery
procedures. Offer patient opportunity to watch delivery in mirror
Advise patient to call physician or report to Labor and Delivery if
She suspects ROM
If contractions are every 5–6 minutes for 1 hour for primip, every 8–10 minutes for 1
hour if multip
Vaginal bleeding
Reduced or absent fetal movement (< 10 kicks/hour)
79
OB-GYN
HSV prophylaxis, if necessary
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROPHYLAXIS OF GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines)
Intrapartum treatment based on risk factors (maternal and infant) vs. universal
screening. Vaginal and perirectal culture at 35–37 weeks gestation. All positive cultures
should be treated with intrapartum prophylaxis (See chart below)

Antibiotics
Penicillin G IV 5 million units initially then 2.5–3 million units every 4 hours until
delivery (preferred agent—OR—)
Ampicillin IV 2g, then 1g every 4 hours until delivery
PCN allergic
(See chart on next page)
80
OB-GYN
Abbreviation: IV = intravenously
* Broader spectrum agents, including an agent active against GBS, might be necessary for treatment of
chorioamnionitis.
† Doses ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 million units are acceptable for the doses administered every 4 hours following the
initial dose. The choice of dose within that range should be guided by which formulations of penicillin G are readily
available to reduce the need for pharmacies to specially prepare doses.
§ Penicillin-allergic patients with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticaria following
administration of penicillin or a cephalosporin are considered to be at high risk for anaphylaxis and should not
receive penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin for GBS intrapartum prophylaxis. For penicillin-allergic patients who
do not have a history of those reactions, cefazolin is the preferred agent because pharmacologic data suggest it
achieves effective intraamniotic concentrations. Vancomycin and clindamycin should be reserved for penicillin-
allergic women at high risk for anaphylaxis.
¶ If laboratory facilities are adequate, clindamycin and erythromycin susceptibility testing (Box 3) should be
performed on prenatal GBS isolates from penicillin-allergic women at high risk for anaphylaxis. If no susceptibility
testing is performed, or the results are not available at the time of labor, vancomycin is the preferred agent for GBS
intrapartum prophylaxis for penicillin-allergic women at high risk for anaphylaxis.
** Resistance to erythromycin is often but not always associated with clindamycin resistance. If an isolate is
resistant to erythromycin, it might have inducible resistance to clindamycin, even if it appears susceptible to
clindamycin. If a GBS isolate is susceptible to clindamycin, resistant to erythromycin, and testing for inducible
clindamycin resistance has been performed and is negative (no inducible resistance), then clindamycin can be used
for GBS intrapartum prophylaxis instead of vancomycin.

OB-GYN
Newborn management: Newborn guidelines apply to all neonates regardless of maternal
GBS status
* Full diagnostic evaluation includes a blood culture, a complete blood count (CBC) including white blood cell
differential and platelet counts, chest radiograph (if respiratory abnormalities are present), and lumbar puncture (if
patient is stable enough to tolerate procedure and sepsis is suspected)
† Antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the most common causes of neonatal sepsis, including intravenous
ampicillin for GBS and coverage for other organisms (including Escherichia coli and other gram-negative
pathogens) and should take into account local antibiotic resistance patterns.
§ Consultation with obstetric providers is important to determine the level of clinical suspicion for chorioamnionitis.
Chorioamnionitis is diagnosed clinically and some of the signs are nonspecific.
¶ Limited evaluation includes blood culture (at birth) and CBC with differential and platelets (at birth and/ or at
6–12 hours of life).
** See table above for indications for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis.
†† If signs of sepsis develop, a full diagnostic evaluation should be conducted and antibiotic therapy initiated.
§§ If =37 weeks’ gestation, observation may occur at home after 24 hours if other discharge criteria have been met,
access to medical care is readily available, and a person who is able to comply fully with instructions for home
observation will be present. If any of these conditions is not met, the infant should be observed in the hospital for at
least 48 hours and until discharge criteria are achieved.
¶¶ Some experts recommend a CBC with differential and platelets at age 6–12 hours.

CLINICAL PEARLS
5–10% of patients will deliver on their due date
Women should ideally receive folate at 28 days prior to conception through the first
8 weeks of pregnancy to decrease the risk of neural tube defects. If patient has had a
previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect, then a daily 4mg dose of folate is
recommended
A 20-week uterus will be palpated at the umbilicus
If patient experiences vaginal bleeding associated with a closed cervix, and a fetus with
cardiac activity is seen on ultrasound, then miscarriage rate is < 3 %
Antiretroviral use during pregnancy decreases risk of transmission of HIV by at least ⅔
and should be strongly recommended (in consultation with an HIV specialist) to every HIV
positive woman
