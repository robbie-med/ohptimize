101. WARTS, SCABIES, LICE AND SUPERFICIAL
TINEA INFECTION MANAGEMENT
TREATMENT OF WARTS
Cryotherapy: Scar formation is minimized
If the wart is large or calloused, then shave it first (e.g. #10 blade)
Apply liquid nitrogen for 5–10 seconds then thaw and refreeze again, usually repeated
for 3 freeze-thaw cycles
Plantar warts often require applications at weekly or biweekly intervals
Duct tape: Apply tape and remove it after 6 days. Wash and gently debride the wart.
Repeat this cycle for 1 month if necessary. There is little documented evidence of its
effectiveness
Other physical modalities: Excision, CO2 laser photodynamic therapy with amino-
levulinic
Pharmacotherapies
Topical salicylic acid (15–40%): Available OTC, often the drug of first choice
Patients with neuropathies should not use these products because of their inability
to judge the extent of therapy and/or poor healing
40% transdermal patch: (Duofilm patch, Mediplast, Dr. Scholl’s): Reserved for
thicker areas and used in plantar warts
Shave the wart as closely as possible, then soak in warm water to moisten.
Vaseline may be applied to areas surrounding the wart to prevent tissue injury
Apply patch with occlusive dressing and keep dry for 48–72 hours. Remove
patch and pare down the wart. Repeat up to 12 weeks
15% transdermal patch (Trans-Ver-Sal): No soaking necessary. Apply before
bedtime and remove in morning. Use up to 12 weeks
17% solution (Duofilm, Compound W): Apply directly to each lesion. Work better
if covered with occlusive dressing
Intralesional candida or mumps skin antigen: Likely to be beneficial for recalcitrant
warts
Pretest patient with 0.1mL intradermally in the forearm. If response occurs, inject
0.1 to 0.3mL into the largest wart or split between 2 warts; max amount is 0.3mL
per treatment
Treat every 3–4 weeks for up to 3 treatments
Side-effects include pruritus, pain, burning or peeling
Imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara), an immunomodulator
Approved for treatment of genital warts but has been used in flat warts when
scarring is a concern and is also used as an adjunct with cryotherapy and topical
Salicylic Acid
Apply at bedtime. Decrease frequency of application if excessive irritation.
Treatment duration can take weeks. Very expensive
Topical retinoids: Tretinoin (Retin-A 0.5%, 0.1% cream, 0.01% and 0.25% gel)
Approved for acne treatment but has been used in flat warts
Apply daily or BID × 4–6 weeks. Adjust frequency of application if fine scaling
and mild erythema occur. Protect surrounding skin with Vaseline. Sun protection
is important
5-flourouracil 5% cream (Efudex)
Approved for actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinomas, but has been used in flat
warts
450
DERM
Apply with a cotton-tipped applicator to individual lesions daily to BID × 3–5
weeks
May cause persistent hyperpigmentation. Sun protection is important as it is
photosensitizing. May need to apply low potency steroid cream to decrease
inflammation after treatment
Genital warts
Provider-administered regimens
Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe. Repeat applications every 1–2
weeks
Podophyllin resin 25% in a compound tincture of Benzoin (Podocon)
Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 80–90% once per week until resolved
Surgical removal either by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave
excision, curettage, or electrosurgery
Patient-applied
Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel (Condylox) BID × 3 days, then 4 days rest,
repeat up to 4 ×
Imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara, generics) or 3.75% (Zyclara) once/day 3 ×/
week up to 16 weeks
Sinecatechins 15% ointment (Veregen): Apply a thin layer TID up to 16 weeks

Nit removal is essential to treatment success. Remove nits manually or use a special
nit comb or a nit removal product (e.g., Clear Lice Egg Remover gel)
Household members should be examined and treated if infested
Oral treatments
Ivermectin (Stromectol 6mg tab)
An anthelmintic agent not approved for treatment of head lice, but is found
to be effective in killing head lice. Used when all other therapies for head lice
have failed
200µg/kg PO once (typical adult dose is 12mg). Repeat in 10 days
Should not be used in children < 15kg because of potential adverse effect on
neurotransmission
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) kills synergistic bacteria in lice. A
prolonged course could promote development of resistance. It should be reserved
for severe or resistant infestations
Pubic lice: CDC Treatment Guidelines 2010
Recommended regimens: Permethrin 1% cream rinse (NIX) or synergized Pyrethrin
(RID) applied and washed off after 10 minutes

452
DERM
If nits are found on body hair, use permethrin preparations or lindane (second-line
agent)
Eyelash infestation: Manually remove lice and nits or apply petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
to eyelids TID–4 ×/day for 8–10 days. Do not use pediculicides to treat eyelash infestations
TREATMENT OF TINEA CAPITIS
Systemic antifungal therapy is required to penetrate the hair follicles
Oral Griseofulvin: The “gold standard” therapy, particularly in children
Microsize (Fulvicin U/F, Grisactin) Tab (500mg), Suspension (125mg/5mL):
Adults: 500mg daily × 6–8 weeks. Children: 5mg/lb/day × 6–8 weeks
Ultramicrosize (Fulvicin P/G, Gris-PEG) Tab (125, 250): Adults: 375mg daily ×
6–8 weeks. Children: 3.3mg/lb/day × 6–8 weeks
Common side-effects include GI disturbances, headache, urticaria, and photo-
sensitivity
Monitor LFTs
Itraconazole (Sporanox), Fluconazole (Diflucan), and Terbinafine (Lamisil) are all
effective but are not FDA approved for this indication and are more expensive than
Griseofulvin
Adjunctive topical therapy
Ketoconazole (Nizoral) 2% shampoo or Selenium Sulfide 1% shampoo (Selsun Blue)
is used to decrease shedding of viable fungi and spores
Shampoo should be applied for 5 minutes, 2–3 ×/week
TREATMENT OF TINEA PEDIS, TINEA CRURIS, AND TINEA CORPORIS
For limited infection, any of the topical antifungal agents in the following Table is
appropriate
Tinea cruris: Topical Azoles are often used because they also have high activity against
Candida. A low dose topical steroid (e.g., 2.5% hydrocortisone) may be used for the
first few days to relieve pruritus
Tinea pedis: Topical Azoles have traditionally been used. However, terbinafine
(Lamisil), an allylamine, has also become the preferred agent of choice
Widespread or refractory infection may need treatment with an oral antifungal agent
Itraconazole (Sporanox): 200mg BID × 1–2 weeks
Terbinafine (Lamisil): 250mg daily × 2–4 weeks
Fluconazole (Diflucan): 150mg once a week × 2–4 weeks

Oral antifungal agents, Itraconazole (Sporanox) and Terbinafine (Lamisil): Used first-
line
Fingernails
Terbinafine (Lamisil): 250mg daily × 6 weeks
Itraconazole (Sporanox): Pulse therapy 200mg PO BID × 7 days, then off for 3
weeks and repeat × 1 cycle
Toenails

Itraconazole (Sporanox): 200mg daily × 12 weeks; monitor LFTs and drug
interactions
Topical Ciclopirox 8% solution (Penlac nail lacquer)
454
DERM
Used in immunocompetent patients with mild to moderate onychomycosis of finger-
nails and toenails without lunula involvement
Apply the lacquer evenly on the entire nail once daily. Once a week, remove the
Penlac with alcohol and then apply Penlac once daily. May take 6 months of therapy
before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed. Up to 48 weeks of daily appli-
cation to achieve a clear nail
Topical antifungal drugs do not penetrate the nail plate adequately to be effective. They
are used after oral treatment to prevent nail re-infection
