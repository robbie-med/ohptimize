15. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN
2 MONTHS TO 2 YEARS OF AGE (For evaluation of infants younger than 2 months with
fever, see Chapter 6, Fever Without a Known Source in the Young Child. For children older
than 2 years, see II. below. Recommendations based on AAP Clinical Practice Guidelines 2011,
reaffirmed in 2016)
Prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI)
Approximately 5%
Prevalence in girls is more than twice that in boys
Rate in uncircumcised boys may be between 5–20 times higher than in circumcised
boys
Risk of undiagnosed UTI
Initial UTI may bring to attention obstructive congenital anomalies
Incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is much higher in age group < 2 years; this
group is at much higher risk for incurring renal injury. Severity of VUR is greater in
infants. Severe form (intrarenal reflux) is limited to infants
Delay in instituting treatment for UTI, especially acute pyelonephritis, increases the
risk of kidney damage
Risk of renal damage increases with the number of UTI recurrences
Etiology
E. coli: 75–90%
Klebsiella
Proteus
Staph saprophyticus
Classification of UTI in children
Asymptomatic bacteriuria: A positive urine culture without any manifestations of
infection; occurs almost exclusively in girls. This condition is benign and does not
cause renal injury
Acute cystitis/Urinary tract infection: Dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain,
incontinence, and malodorous urine. Cystitis does not cause fever or renal injury
Pyelonephritis: Characterized by the following–abdominal or flank pain, fever,
malaise, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea. Infants may show nonspecific
symptoms such as jaundice, poor feeding, irritability, and weight loss
History and physical exam
History
Clinical symptoms (dysuria, frequency) may be absent, but may include a history
of fever, crying on urination, foul-smelling urine, or an altered voiding pattern
Ask about nonspecific findings of increased irritability, vomiting, diarrhea or
constipation
Physical exam
Vital signs including temperature
Degree of toxicity and dehydration
Irritability
Lab/Evaluation: A urine culture is recommended for confirmation and appropriate therapy
In toilet-trained children, a midstream urine sample is usually satisfactory. If the
culture shows greater than 100,000 colonies of a single pathogen, or if there are 10,000
colonies and the child is symptomatic, it is considered a UTI
A catheterized specimen should be obtained when assurance to rule in or rule out the
diagnosis is necessary. This is the most accurate way to diagnose a UTI

PEDS
In infants, the application of an adhesive, sealed, sterile collection bag after
disinfection of the skin of the genitals can be used, but this approach is problematic
as a positive urinalysis and culture may reflect a contaminant, particularly in girls and
uncircumcised boys
If the urinalysis result is positive, the patient is symptomatic, and there is a single
organism cultured with a colony count greater than 100,000, a diagnosis of a UTI
can be made
If any of these criteria are not met, confirmation of infection with a catheterized
sample is recommended

Treatment: UTI
If the patient is assessed as toxic/dehydrated/unable to maintain PO intake, the patient
should be hospitalized
In the non-toxic child with a positive urinalysis or urine culture
Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Augmentin): 25–45mg/kg/day in 2 doses. Available in
200mg/5mL or 400mg/5mL suspension
TMP/SMX (Bactrim): 8mg/kg TMP and 40mg SMX per day in 2 doses. Available
in 40mg TMP/200mg SMX/5mL suspension
Cefixime (Suprax): 8mg/kg every 24 hours or 4mg/kg every 12 hours. Available in
100mg/5 mL or 200mg/5mL suspension
Cefpodoxime (Vantin): 10mg/kg/day in 2 doses. Available in 50mg/5mL or 100
mg/5mL suspension
Cefprozil (Cefzil): 15mg/kg every 12 hours. Available in 125mg/5mL or
250mg/5mL suspension
Cephalexin (Keflex): 25–50mg/kg/day divided every 6–12 hours. Available in
125mg/5mL or 250mg/5mL suspension
Be aware of local bacterial resistance pattern that affect antibiotic choices, particularly
TMP/SMX and Cephalexin
Do not use Nitrofurantoin in febrile infants with UTIs due to insufficient therapeutic
serum concentration
If the expected response does not occur in 2 days, the child should be re-evaluated and
another urine specimen should be cultured
Duration: 7–14 days
Treatment: Pyelonephritis
Well-appearing children may be treated with oral therapy
Children who are dehydrated, are unable to drink fluids, or in whom sepsis is a
possibility should be admitted to the hospital
Evaluation
UTIs in infants and young children serve as markers for abnormalities of the urinary
tract. Imaging of the urinary tract is recommended in every febrile infant and young
child with a first UTI
Ultrasound of kidneys and bladder
Should be done promptly in patients who do not respond within 2 days of
antibiotics therapy. Can be delayed in children responding to treatment
A normal ultrasound does not exclude VUR
Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG)
Will detect vesicoureteral reflux. Grades of severity are recognized (I–V)
Child should be free of infection at time of this study to avoid bladder irritability
If vesicoureteral reflux is present, a DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan should be
50
PEDS
performed to assess whether renal scarring is present
GREATER THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE
Diagnosis may be simpler as the child may be able to localize symptoms to the urinary
tract as well as provide a clean-catch specimen
Children in this age group are much less likely to have factors predisposing them to renal
damage and are at lower risk of developing renal damage
In all patients < 5 years and in boys > 5 years diagnostic imaging with ultrasound and
voiding cystourethrogram should be considered. Further management is dictated by
findings on diagnostic imaging and clinical course
In girls > 5 years with no systemic signs, diagnostic imaging is not necessary with the first
UTI, but may be indicated in cases of recurrent UTI
CLINICAL PEARLS
Between 1–2 years, the prevalence of UTIs in febrile girls is 8.1% and in boys is 1.9%
Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is controversial, but some studies have indicated
that the risk of renal scarring is low and that treatment does not decrease the risk of UTI
recurrence
Recurrent UTI is 2 UTIs over a 6 month period. It is important to determine if a subsequent
UTI is a recurrence or an inadequately treated initial UTI
