86. COMMON FRACTURES/DESCRIBING FRACTURES
INTRODUCTION: It is essential for all primary care physicians to be able to accurately
describe fractures and dislocations for accurate documentation and communication with other
health providers
FRACTURES: Fractures can be described based on location, fracture type, the relation-
ship of bone fragments to one another, and the relationship to surrounding tissues as seen on
radiographic images
Anatomic location
Name: Which bone is fractured?
Location: Where is the fracture located?
Diaphysis, metaphysis, epiphysis, intra-articular
Proximal, middle, distal third
Fractures in children may involve the growth plate (physis)
Special location may be used (e.g., intertrochanteric femur fracture)
Fracture type: Includes fracture line, fragments, and forces involved in the fracture
Fracture line describes direction of fracture
Transverse: Fracture runs 90° to the long axis of the bone
Oblique: Fracture runs less than 90° to the long axis of the bone
Spiral: Torsion results in a curved fracture around the bone
Greenstick: A fracture of only one cortex in children with disrupted periosteum
opposite of the fracture
Fragmented fractures
Comminuted: More than two fracture fragments
Segmental: Type of comminuted with large well-defined fragments
Fracture forces
Impaction: Force down the shaft, forcing one fragment into another
Avulsion: Muscle contraction (through force of a ligament or tendon) pulls a
fragment of bone off from its attachment site
Compression: Usually seen in cancellous flat bones (vertebral bodies)
Torus or buckle: Commonly seen in children during fall on outstretched hand
(FOOSH) at distal radial metaphysis. Caused by axial force on a long bone with
incomplete fracture of the cortex.
Stress fracture: Skeletal breaks resulting from overuse in bones with normal
composition
Insufficiency fracture: Breaks in bone with impaired healing capacity (e.g.,
osteoporosis) when normal stress is applied
Relationship of fragments
Alignment: Describes direction and angle of distal fragment relative to proximal
fragment, e.g., distal femur fragment is angulated 15° laterally
Displacement: Shifting of fragments in relation to one another. Usually described in
terms of percentage of subluxation. Fracture with 100% displacement and shortening
is referred to as a bayonet fracture
Relationship to surrounding tissues
Open: Skin broken by either outside forces or fracture fragment
Closed: Skin intact

DISLOCATION AND SUBLUXATION
Dislocation: Complete disruption of joint so that articular surfaces are no longer in contact
Description based on the position of distal bone relative to proximal bone, e.g.,
posterior elbow dislocation = displacement of ulnar olecranon, posterior relative to the
humerus
May be associated with fractures
Bones often lie side-by-side, locked in that position until dislocation reduced
Subluxation: Incomplete disruption of a joint where articular surfaces are in contact but
not perfectly aligned
TERMINOLOGY: Orthopedics has unique language to describe bony structures and
relationships
Salter classification: Refers to physeal fractures in children
Fracture through the physis
II-Fracture through the physis with continuation towards the metaphysis
III-Fracture through the physis with continuation towards the epiphysis
IV-Fracture through the physis with continuation towards both the epiphysis and
metaphysis
V-Crush injury to the physis
Long bone locations
Diaphysis: Shaft of long bones
Metaphysis: Widened “neck” portion of bone adjacent to epiphysis
Epiphysis: Ossification center at the end of long bones, separated from the metaphysis
by the physis in children
Physis: Cartilaginous growth plate
Other terminology
Ankylosis: Restricted motion in a joint
Apophysis: Ossification center at the insertion of a tendon
Arthrodesis: Surgical stiffening/fusion of a joint
Kyphosis: Curvature of the spine with posterior convexity
Lordosis: Curvature of the spine with anterior convexity
Spondylolisthesis: Slippage of 1 vertebra on another
Spondylolysis: Fracture of the pars interarticularis
Valgus: Distal part away from midline
Varus: Distal part toward midline
Volar: Towards palmar surface of hand
