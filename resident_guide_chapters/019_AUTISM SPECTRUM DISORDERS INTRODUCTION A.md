19. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS
INTRODUCTION
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) include a broad spectrum of characteristics with
deficits in communication and social skills as well as stereotypical behaviors. Age of onset
before 3 years-old
Prevalence increased 10-fold over the past 50 years due to increased inclusion criteria
from DSM-IV and improved support through the Americans for Disabilities Act. Per the
CDC about 1 in 88 children have ASD
Etiology is not known, but theories support genetic inheritance. Males are predominantly
affected
Specific types
With or without accompanying intellectual impairment
With or without accompanying language impairment
Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor
Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder
With catatonia
RED FLAGS
No babbling or pointing by 12 months
No single words by 16 months
No 2-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months
Loss of language or social skills
Other risk factors: Siblings with ASD, parental or caregiver concern, physician concern
SYMPTOMS/SIGNS
Joint attention deficits (key factor suggestive of ASD): Difficulty sharing enjoyment of
event/object with another person
Social skill deficits
Difficulty sharing the emotional state of others
Content being alone
Rarely make eye contact
Communication deficits: Lack the desire to communicate; decreased pre-speech with
delayed babbling; lack of expressions like “uh-oh;” lack of recognition of parental voice
Regression: Up to one-third of children will begin speaking, but have regression by 15–24
months. May be gradual or sudden
Play skills: Usually lack creativity, usually ritualistic; e.g., lining up crayons rather than
coloring with them
Stereotypical behaviors: Unusual attachments to objects, peculiar mannerisms,
obsessions, compulsions, self-injury, head banging, rocking, twirling for internal
stimulation
SURVEILLANCE
Ask routine developmental questions at each well child visit (See Chapter 2, The
Developing Child)
If surveillance is negative, schedule next preventive visit
If surveillance is positive, provide education and refer for comprehensive ASD evaluation,
early intervention, or early childhood education services and audiologist evaluation

SCREENING
Formal screening should be done with ASD-specific screening tools at each 18– and
24–month well child visit. The AAP recommends the Modified Checklist for Autism in
Toddlers (M-CHAT)—See section IX, Resources, below
If screening is negative, schedule next preventative visit
If screening is positive, assess for false positives. If the screening test was concerning,
provide parental education, refer for a comprehensive ASD evaluation or early intervention
DIAGNOSIS: VIA A COMPREHENSIVE ASD TEAM
Thorough history including past medical, developmental, behavior and three generation
family history
Complete physical exam for dysmorphic features or neurologic abnormalities, suggesting
secondary ASD
Developmental evaluation for functioning levels of social skills and communication
Assess parental education
Routine lab work is not necessary, unless there is concern for secondary causes
Consider EEG
MANAGEMENT: Goals of multidisciplinary treatment are to optimize independence and
quality of life while reducing core features of ASD and family distress
Behavioral therapy: Early intervention with > 25 hours per week leads to improved
cognition, language and adaptive skills
Family therapy: Support caregivers’ stress, financial responsibilities, and improve patient
and family outcomes
Identify medical causes for new onset maladaptive behavior
Pharmacologic therapy: Focus on adverse symptom reduction while managing
medication side-effects
Probiotics: GI upset
Melatonin: Sleep dysfunction
SSRI (e.g., Fluoxetine): Anxiety, behavior rigidity or repetition, OCD symptoms
Atypical antipsychotics: Consider for self injury, aggression, explosive outbursts
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
Lack evidence-based medicine support
A majority of families will try at least one CAM
A strong patient-doctor relationship can help identify proven ineffective or potentially
harmful treatments
PROGNOSIS: Multifactorial and difficult to predict when less than 3 years-old
Improved outcomes: Early intervention, early onset of joint attention, functional speech
by 5 years-old, IQ >70
Poorer outcomes: Earlier diagnosis, association with medical condition, comorbid mental
retardation, seizures
Treatment of psychiatric aspects such as anxiety, depression improves overall function

VACCINE SAFETY
There have been many studies demonstrating the lack of association between vaccines and
autism. Per the Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report, “the evidence favors rejection
of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.” CDC supports
the IOM conclusion that there is no relationship between vaccines containing thimerosal and

autism rates in children. Bottom line: Vaccines do not cause autism
CLINICAL PEARLS
Autism spectrum disorder is a broad definition of deficits in communication, social skills,
and maladaptive behavior
Evidence has shown that earlier intervention has improved functional independence. Do
not wait for a formal diagnosis before starting services. Avoid the “wait and see” approach
Formal screening should be performed at the 18– and 24–month well child visits with
formal ASD tools, such as M-CHAT
Any red flags, parental concerns or positive screenings should have a comprehensive ASD
evaluation
