34. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP)
DEFINITION
An acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that includes both
Symptoms of acute infection
Physical examination and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia and/or presence
of an acute infiltrate on chest x-ray
Pneumonia is considered nosocomial (not community-acquired) if the patient has been
hospitalized or treated in an extended care facility for 14 days prior to presentation of
current illness
SIGNIFICANCE
Up to 5.6 million cases/year with as many as 1.1 million hospitalizations
Annual incidence of pneumonia in patients > 65 is approximately 1%
Combination of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and influenza ranks as the sixth
leading cause of death in the U.S. Inpatient mortality has remained around 25% over the
last 4 decades, despite advances in antibiotics and critical care medicine. Mortality in
outpatient CAP is less than 1%
ETIOLOGY
Neonate: Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative enteric bacteria,
(E.Coli, Klebsiella), Chlamydia trachomatis (neonate to 3 months), Viral pathogens,
(CMV, HSV, Rubella)
< 1 year-old: Viral pathogens, (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus),
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus
1‒18 years-old: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae. Staphylococcus
aureus, Viral pathogens, (influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus), Chlamydia
pneumoniae, Mycoplasma (school-age children)
Adult: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacilli, viruses, Staphylococcus pneumoniae,
Legionella pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Pneumocystis carinii
Elderly, extended-care facility resident: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Anaerobic organisms (in
cases of suspected/possible aspiration), MSSA, MRSA
Immunocompromised: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Anaerobic organisms (in cases of suspected/
possible aspiration), fungal organisms (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcus,
etc.), Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium spp., cytomegalovirus
DIAGNOSIS
History
Symptoms
General: Fever/chills/rigors, fatigue, generalized malaise
Respiratory: Cough (may be productive or nonproductive), dyspnea, pleuritic
chest pain
Musculoskeletal: Myalgia/arthralgia
Timing and temporal relationship of preceding symptoms
Sudden onset: Indicative of “classic” pneumococcal pneumonia
Preceding influenza pneumonia: Often staphylococcal pneumonia

ID
Risk Factors for pneumonia: Extremes of age, smoker, severe illness or immu-
nocompromised state, extended care facility resident, EtOH abuse, HIV/AIDS,
aspiration risk factors
Physical exam
Vitals signs: Febrile, tachypneic, tachycardic, check for hypoxia
Assess hydration: Mucous membranes, skin turgor, urine output
Lung exam
Inspection: Retractions, accessory muscle use, asymmetry in inspiration secondary
to splinting
Auscultation
Rales (crackles) most common finding in CAP
Rhonchi
Bronchial breath sounds due to consolidation
Whispered pectoriloquy (present at area of consolidation)
Egophony (“E” to “A” changes, present at area of consolidation)
Palpation
Tactile fremitus (present at area of consolidation)
Percussion asymmetry (dullness over area of consolidation)
Additional findings to lead diagnosis and therapy
Signs of immunocompromised state (lymphadenopathy, thrush, Kaposi’s sarcoma,
wasting)
Signs of malignancy (as above plus weight loss, smoking history, clubbing)
Radiographic findings
Recommended for all patients suspected of pneumonia
Helps to predict severity of disease: Multilobar infiltrates and pleural effusions are
associated with increased mortality
CXR may be falsely negative in dehydrated patients
“Classic” findings
Lobar infiltrate: Commonly associated with Streptococcus pneumonia
Pleural effusion: Streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic infection
Nodular or reticular infiltrates: Mycoplasma or Chlamydial atypical organisms
Cavity with air-fluid level: Anaerobic lung abscess
Upper lobe cavitary lesion: Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Diffuse bilateral infiltrates: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, viral
Laboratory evaluation
Oxygenation
Pulse oximetry: Consider ED evaluation and inpatient admission for any patients
with persistent hypoxia and CAP
Arterial blood gas: Consider ordering in patients with history of COPD, suspicion
of pulmonary embolus, or hypoxia. pO2 < 60mmHg is predictive of increased
mortality
Sputum stain/culture: Often not useful in ambulatory CAP, not a high-yield predictor
of bacterial etiology
Blood culture: Not necessary for outpatient therapy. Only 5–14% of hospitalized
patients with CAP will have positive blood cultures and do not usually result in a
change in therapy
CBC: Leukocyte count should not guide diagnosis or treatment—it has not been
shown to impact mortality
Electrolytes
Hyponatremia can occur with CAP, most commonly with Legionella pneumonia
Na < 130mEq/L predictive of increased mortality
BUN > 20mg/dL, creatinine > 1.2, and serum glucose > 250, all predictive of
increased mortality
HIV status: Check in any patient with risk factors or suspected opportunistic
pneumonia (PCP, fungal, etc.)
Legionella and pneumococcal antigen: Obtain with severe CAP, risk factors

ADMISSION CRITERIA—Consider admission for the following
There are various prognostic models including the CURB-65 criteria (Confusion,
Uremia, Respiratory rate, low Blood pressure, age ≥65) and the Pneumonia Severity Index
(PSI)—See below
Should be guided by clinical judgment and a determination if patient is able to reliably
follow outpatient recommendations
OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF ADULTS
Previously healthy and no use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months
Macrolide (strong recommendation): Azithromycin (Zithromax), Clarithromycin
(Biaxin) or Erythromycin
Doxycycline (weak recommendation)
Presence of comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver or renal disease; diabetes
mellitus; alcoholism; malignancies; asplenia; immunosuppressing conditions or use of
immunosuppressing drugs; or use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months (in which
case an alternative from a different class should be selected)
A respiratory Fluoroquinolone (Moxifloxacin, Gemifloxacin, or Levofloxacin
[750mg]), (strong recommendation)
A ß-lactam (Amoxicillin 1g TID or Augmentin XR 2g BID) plus Macrolide (strong
recommendation; level 1 evidence)
Alternative to ß-lactam: Ceftriaxone, Cefpodoxime, Cefuroxime (500mg BID)
Alternative to Macrolide: Doxycycline
In regions with a high rate (> 25%) of infection with high-level Macrolide-resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae, consider use of alternative agents listed above in (B) for
patients without comorbidities (moderate recommendation)
Both fluoroquinolones and macrolides have the potential for QTc prolongation that may
lead to Torsades de Pointes
Recent data showed that Azithromycin and Levofloxacin were associated with the risk
of cardiovascular death when compared to Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, and placebo
When choosing an antibiotic, consider the risk particularly in patients with existing
QT prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, or concurrent
antiarrhythmic drug therapy
For therapy of influenza (viral etiology of pneumonia) See VII. A. 3.
VIRAL ETIOLOGIES OF PNEUMONIA
Influenza
Responsible for 25,000 to 50,000 deaths annually in the U.S., predominantly in the
elderly and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary or metabolic diseases.
Influenza-associated pneumonia should be considered in high-risk patients with
underlying disease and in residents of chronic care facilities during October through
May, especially in patients who haven’t been vaccinated
Antiviral therapy for influenza: Should be considered for all patients greater than 2
weeks-old, most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. Oseltamivir
(Tamiflu) first line agent, available as generic
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Though considered mainly an infection in pediatric
populations, can lead to serious lower respiratory tract infections in adults during the
winter season, particularly in the elderly
Other novel viral etiologies (including coronavirus): See Chapter 46: Emerging
Infectious Diseases
OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP
Advise patient to call or return to office for fever > 102°, worsening shortness of breath,
inability to swallow medications or remain hydrated, chest pain, hemoptysis, or failure to
improve after 2 days of therapy

ID
Follow-up CXR not necessary: CXR findings may take weeks or months to return
to normal. Follow-up CXR is warranted if suspicion of underlying pathology (e.g.,
malignancy)
PREVENTION
Pneumococcal polysaccharide antigen vaccine: Risk for acquiring complications of
pneumonia is reduced by 2/3 following vaccination, indicated for
Asplenic patients
Immune-competent patients > 65
Diabetes
COPD
Chronic renal failure
Malignancy
CAD and CHF
Chronic liver disease
HIV/AIDS
Consider in any chronic, debilitating illness
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pediatric population: Effective in decreasing
pediatric pneumococcal pneumonia
Influenza vaccine: Indicated yearly for all patients at risk for pneumonia
CLINICAL PEARLS
Pneumococcus remains the most common bacterial etiology of pneumonia in both children
and adults
Presence of dementia or confusion in an elderly patient increases the likelihood of a chest
film being positive for pneumonia. Dementia/confusion may be the only symptom in
elderly patients with pneumonia
Most common pneumonia in patients with HIV is pneumococcal pneumonia. Ask about
risk factors and evaluate for signs of HIV including thrush, oral hairy leukoplakia,
seborrheic dermatitis
Treat early: Delay in antibiotic therapy associated with increased mortality
Treat empirically: Sputum gram stains are not usually helpful
The most common mechanism by which the lung is inoculated with pathogenic organisms
is through microaspiration of oropharyngeal contents, a process that occurs in otherwise
healthy individuals during sleep
