76. BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA
DEFINITION: Nodular enlargement of the prostate occurring in the periurethral region of
the gland generally among men > 50 years-old
GENERAL
Is present in 50% of men over 50 and 90% of men over 80 years-old
At 75, half of men have symptoms of BPH
Pathology of BPH is hyperplastic growth pattern of stroma and epithelium
HISTORY
Lower urinary tract symptoms: Must assess for two categories
Obstructive voiding symptoms: Delay in initiation, urinary hesitancy, involuntary
interruption of stream, weak stream, straining to void, a sensation of incomplete
voiding, postvoid dribbling
Hyperactive bladder symptoms: Nocturia, urinary frequency, urgency, urge
incontinence, bladder pain or dysuria
Previous surgeries and other therapies used for BPH
Symptoms of UTI, cancer (blood in stool or urine, weight loss)
Medications which may increase symptoms including diuretics, anticholinergics,
opioids, caffeine, OTC decongestants
See American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index Chart below
Family history of prostate cancer
History of diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, stroke

PHYSICAL EXAM
Abdominal exam (distended bladder)
Digital rectal exam for enlargement. Note that prostate size on exam correlates poorly
with symptoms but correlates well with potential response to therapy (prostates ≥40mL
respond better to 5 α-reductase inhibitors). Consistency of prostate should be rubbery, firm
but not hard or nodular.
Focused neurological exam
INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION IN BPH
Urinalysis (infection or hematuria)
Consider serum creatinine or postvoid residual only if urinary retention is severe
Prostatic specific antigen: Optional but many national organizations have recommended
against as there is a significant increase in morbidity and expense and no significant
decrease in mortality. The risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient and the
strategy of “shared decision making” should be employed
Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for hydronephrosis
MANAGEMENT
Behavioral: No fluids after dinner, no caffeine after noon, decrease or stop alcohol;
minimize potential exacerbating medications. Timed voiding and double voiding
Watchful waiting: Progression is not inevitable. 31–55% will improve with no therapy.
Approximately 7% will develop urinary retention over the next 4 years
Medical therapy
General algorithm: Gradually increase doses over 4–6 weeks to decrease orthostatic
effects. Note: α-adrenergic antagonists work fastest and 5-α-reductase inhibitors
require long-term therapy
Predominantly obstructive voiding symptoms
Small gland (< 40cc) and/or PSA < 1.5ng/mL: Use α-blockers
Large gland (> 40cc) and/or PSA > 1.5ng/mL: Use α-blocker and/or
5-α-reductase inhibitor (combination therapy has been shown to be more
effective than monotherapy, but may be limited due to increased side-effects)
Mixed obstructive voiding and bladder hyperactivity symptoms use combination
antimuscarinic and α-blocker therapy
α-adrenergic antagonists: Takes 2–4 weeks for full effect
Selective (theoretically less extra-gonadal side-effects)
Tamsulosin (Flomax): 0.4mg to be taken ½ hour after the same meal each day
and may increase to 0.8mg after 2–4 weeks
Silodosin (Rapaflo): 8mg daily with a meal
Nonselective (theoretically more extra-gonadal side-effects)
Doxazosin (Cardura): Start with 1mg at bedtime for 7 days. If well tolerated,
gradually increase dose to 8mg daily
Terazosin (Hytrin): Start with 1mg at bedtime for 7 days. If well tolerated,
gradually increase dose to 20mg daily
Alfuzosin (Uraxatrol): 10mg once daily with food
Side-effects
Gonadal: Erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation
Extra–gonadal: Dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (avoid taking within 4
hours of a Phosphodiesterase inhibitor), fatigue, headache, nasal congestion,
dry mouth
5-α-reductase inhibitors: Decrease conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.
Takes 2–6 months for full effect
Finasteride (Proscar): 5mg PO daily
347
GEN
Dutasteride (Avodart): 0.5mg PO daily
Side-effects: Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, abnormal ejaculation,
gynecomastia, decreases PSA level by 50%, 6% decreased risk of prostate cancer
(but if patient does get prostate cancer these medicines increase the risk of it being
a high-grade cancer)
Antimuscarinic agents: Takes 12 weeks for full effect
Selective (for the bladder detrusor muscle, less extra-urinary anticholinergic side-
effects)
Solifenacin (Vesicare): 5–10mg PO daily
Darifenacin (Enablex): 7.5–15mg PO daily
Nonselective (more extra–urinary anticholinergic side-effects)
Oxybutynin (Ditropan): 5mg PO BID, or 5–20mg CR PO daily
Trospium (Sanctura): 20mg PO BID, or 60mg XR PO daily
Tolterodine (Detrol): 2mg PO BID, or 2–4mg XR PO daily
Fesoterodine (Toviaz): 4–8mg PO daily
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor: Only one has FDA approval for BPH. Works through
smooth muscle relaxation (the phosphodiesterase–5 enzyme is located in prostate
tissue). Takes 4 weeks for full effect
Tadalafil (Cialis): 2.5–5mg daily
Alternative therapies: Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens), Rye grass pollen extract
(Cernilton), Pygeum
All have conflicting evidence, although each has several poorly designed studies
showing efficacy. The American Urologic Association does not endorse the use of
any of these products for the treatment of BPH
Surgical therapy: Indications include medical treatment failure, obstructive renal failure,
bladder stones, chronic UTIs
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): Improvement in 75–96% with
impotence in 5–10% and retrograde ejaculation in 75%
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)
Patients with moderate to severe symptoms and small prostates
Improvement in 78–83%, with less retrograde ejaculation than TURP (25%)
Open prostatectomy
Usually done when prostate is too large to be done by TURP/TUIP
Improvement in 94–100%
Impotence in 5–39%, incontinence in < 1%, retrograde ejaculation in 36–95%
Minimally invasive therapy
Laser prostatectomy: Advantages include less blood loss and outpatient surgery.
Disadvantages include lack of tissue for pathology and more irritative voiding
complaints
Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA): A catheter is placed in the
urethra and radiofrequencies are used to heat the tissue resulting in coagulative
necrosis
Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate: High current densities cause a cavity
in the prostatic urethra
Hyperthermia: Microwave hyperthermia with transurethral catheter
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU): Thermal tissue ablation
Intraurethral stents: For patients with poor surgical risk
Transurethral balloon dilation of the prostate: Most effective in small prostates
CLINICAL PEARLS
For mild symptoms, reassurance and reassessment are appropriate management
Distinguish between overactive bladder and obstructive symptoms to guide management
Of all these medicines, 5-α-reductase inhibitors take the longest to start working, but they
are the only BPH medicines that have been shown to decrease the risk of acute urinary
retention and the rate of progression to surgical therapy
