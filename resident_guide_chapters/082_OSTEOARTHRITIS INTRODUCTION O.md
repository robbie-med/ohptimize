82. OSTEOARTHRITIS
INTRODUCTION
Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease—DJD) is the most common form of joint
disease. It affects over 25 million in the U.S. and occurs more frequently with age.
Characterized by marked loss of cartilage and joint space
Etiology is unknown, likely multifactorial. Risk factors include increased age, genetics,
obesity, female sex and a prior history of trauma. It is more common in the presence of
other joint disorders such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout and Paget’s disease
Two types of osteoarthritis
Primary: Most often affects the hands (DIP and PIP joints), knees, hips, spine (neck
and lower back)
Secondary: May occur at any joint after an articular injury or secondary to a
congenital or developmental cause, genetic defects, infectious causes or other
rheumatological diseases
SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS
Pain worsens with weight bearing and with more advanced disease, after prolonged
movement of the affected joint
Pain improves with rest
Morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes
Joint stiffness after sitting in one position for a long period of time
Joint instability
Loss of function
Joints enlarge and are tender to palpation
Often have crepitus and limited ROM, possibly with effusions
Heberden’s nodes (DIP joints) and Bouchard’s nodes (PIP joints)
Note: Systemic signs should prompt exploration for other causes
X-RAY: Used to confirm diagnosis. Findings do not always correlate with pain. Obtain weight-
bearing x-rays to best assess joint space.
Joint space narrowing/collapse
Osteophyte formation
Bony sclerosis
Cyst formation
MANAGEMENT: Goal of treatment is to control pain, improve joint function, maintain
normal body weight, and achieve a healthy lifestyle
Non-pharmacologic
Weight loss and joint protection
Muscle strengthening and stretching
Routine non-impact training, i.e., cross-training to include biking and swimming
Joint un-loaders, orthotics
Knee brace or sleeve
Ambulation assistive devices
CAM treatment: Acupuncture
Surgery for end-stage knee and hip arthritis

Pharmacologic
Acetaminophen is equally effective compared to NSAIDs for knee OA. Should be
tried first line due to side-effects associated with NSAIDs. Use for mild–moderate
pain. Dose up to 4g/day (3g/day for elderly)
NSAIDs. Use in patients who have an inadequate response to Acetaminophen. Take
with food. Can be used with a GI protective agent (PPI or Misoprostol) in patients at
risk of peptic ulcers. Use for mild–moderate pain. Use caution due to GI and renal
side-effects
Celecoxib (Celebrex): COX-2 inhibitor. Use for patients at high risk of GI
complications
Topical NSAIDs
Voltaren (Diclofenac) 1% Gel: Topical NSAID gel approved for OA of the knee
and hands. Lower extremities: 4g 4 ×/day max 16g/day; upper extremities 2g 4 ×/
day max 8g/day. Max total dose 32g/day
Pennsaid (Diclofenac) 2% topical solution: Approved for OA of the knees; 2
pumps 2 ×/day per knee
Tramadol (µ-opioid receptor agonist). Use for moderate to moderately severe pain.
Controlled substance
Topical Capsaicin cream 0.025–0.075%. Use as an adjunct. Available OTC. Apply 3–4
×/day. May cause transient burning on application. Avoid contact with eyes
Narcotic pain medications. Use sparingly for severe pain or acute flares
Intra-articular injections
Corticosteroids. Only indicated for symptom/pain control, does not slow progression
of arthritis. Use triamcinolone 20–40mg (or equivalent) for knee and hip, often
combined with 1% lidocaine. Patients should rest 48 hours after injection. Limit
injections to no more often than every 3–4 months, no more than 3–4 per year
Intra-articular hyaluronic acid derivatives (e.g., Euflexxa, Orthovisc, Synvisc). Use
as viscosupplementation and indicated for OA of the knee. Series of 1–5 weekly
injections, depending on product
Surgery
Indications
Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing
symptoms of buckling or locking
Patients who have failed more conservative therapy
Types of Surgery
Arthroscopic joint irrigation and debridement: Use for debridement of torn
meniscus and removal of proliferative synovium and loose articular cartilage
fragments. Efficacy is controversial. A controlled trial by Moseley, et al. (See
Reference below) of 180 patients with OA of the knee showed that arthroscopic
lavage and debridement was no better than the placebo procedure
Total joint arthroplasty: Use for patients with severe pain who have failed medical
management or have a significant decrease in activities of daily living. Implants
last 10–15 years or longer
Chondrocyte grafting: Use for younger patients with localized osteoarthritis or
chondral defect
CLINICAL PEARLS
Maintaining a healthy body weight may limit progression and symptoms of osteoarthritis
Can be diagnosed by history and physical exam alone; imaging may be used to confirm
diagnosis
Many patients with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis have no clinical symptoms
Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of impaired mobility in the elderly; 70–90% of
Americans age 75 or older have arthritis in at least one joint
If knee pain occurs overnight or awakes them while sleeping, should consider other
etiologies including inflammatory arthritis, tumors, infections, or crystal disease
