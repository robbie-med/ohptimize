44. AMBULATORY HIV/AIDS MANAGEMENT
The optimal management of patients with HIV/AIDS is a constantly evolving process. These
recommendations are intended for physicians with experience in treating patients with HIV/
AIDS who have a baseline level of knowledge. These recommendations are for management
of adults with HIV and AIDS.
HISTORY
History of present illness: In addition to standard history, ask specifically about: Fatigue,
weight loss, weakness, fever, chills, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, rash or skin changes,
oral lesions, dysphagia/odynophagia, change in vision, cough, dyspnea, easy bruising,
diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, vaginal/penile discharge, yeast
infections, anal pain, headaches, confusion/seizures
Past medical history: Hospitalizations/operations, drug allergies, immunizations,
medications, history of infectious diseases (varicella/zoster, TB or positive skin tests, HSV,
hepatitis, STDs), date of initial diagnosis of HIV and AIDS
Social history: Possible medications, current sexual practices, drug use, smoking and
alcohol, diet, stressors, support systems
Medications: An accurate medication history is important since many antiretroviral
medications interact with prescription and over the counter medications (e.g., St. John’s
wort)
PHYSICAL EXAM
General exam (cachexia)
Ophthalmic exam (visual field defects, fundi)
Dermatologic exam (seborrheic dermatitis, Kaposi’s sarcoma, tinea, varicella, HSV, etc.)
Oral and dental exam (candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, HSV, KS)
Pulmonary
Cardiovascular
Abdominal exam
Neurologic exam (baseline)
Consider rectal exam (condyloma, perirectal HSV)
Genital exam (candida, HSV, chancre, HPV, etc.)

Immunizations
Pneumococcal vaccine: Strongly recommended
Recommended for all patients with HIV with CD4 counts over 200. Optional for
patients with CD4 counts less than 200 as the response to vaccination is poor
Revaccination every 5 years may be considered
Impact on viral load: May transiently increase the viral load. Viral load testing
should be delayed for 4 weeks after the immunization
General: Incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia is increased over 20 times in
patients with HIV and the risk of pneumococcal bacteremia is increased 150–
300 fold higher than age matched controls without HIV. Pneumococcal vaccine
should be given at the earliest opportunity and repeated once at 5 years. 88% of
asymptomatic HIV infected patients responded to at least 1 component of the
23-valent vaccines
Influenza vaccine: Generally recommended
Recommended by the centers for disease control (CDC). Impact on viral load:
May raise the viral load, therefore, viral load testing should be delayed for 4 weeks
after the immunization
General: Patients with HIV do not have worse infections with influenza than
non-infected patients; however, the advantage of preventing influenza is that the
symptoms will not be confused with symptoms of an opportunistic infection and
unnecessary evaluations will be avoided. Other advantages include the increased
risk of persons with HIV for bacterial infections that may complicate influenza.
Protective antibody titers develop in 52–89% of patients with asymptomatic
disease and 13– 58% of patients with AIDS
Hepatitis B vaccine
Recommended for individuals without evidence of prior exposure to HBV, even if
CD4 < 200
General: Patients with HIV and hepatitis B have a 19–37% risk of becoming
chronic carriers (3–6 times higher risk than patients without HIV). Response rate
to the vaccine is 25–60%
Hepatitis A vaccine: Generally recommended for those who engage in anal intercourse,
injection drug users, or susceptible patients with chronic liver disease
Haemophilus Influenzae type B, diphtheria/tetanus, MMR: Same as for non-infected
patients
Human papillomavirus vaccine
Recommended for men and women ages 9–45 years-old
Continued Pap and HPV testing for women who are over age 65 and living with
HIV
Travel vaccines: Same as for non-infected patients, but no live vaccines
Varicella
Vaccine: May be considered in those without a history of varicella, with CD4
counts > 200
Immune globulin: With significant exposure to chicken pox or shingles in patients
without history of either condition (or negative antibody titer) give Varicella
Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) 5 vials (1.25mL each) IM if < 96 hours post-
exposure (preferable within 48 hours)
Human papillomavirus (HPV): Women and high risk males 11–26; HPV quadrivalent
vaccine, months 0, 2 and 6
Vaccines not to give: Oral polio vaccine (OPV), varicella vaccine, other live vaccines
Other information: Provide patient with written information on HIV/AIDS, support
groups, unsafe and safe sexual and IV drug use practices. Certain sexual practices are safe
for patient to continue to engage in (activities which do not exchange body fluids) and
should be discussed explicitly with the patient. Past contacts should be notified, but this
can be deferred until the doctor patient relationship has been better established. Explain to
patient the need for frequent visits and blood tests

PROPHYLAXIS
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis
Pneumocystis pneumonia is caused by a fungus called Pneumocystis jiroveci. It is
spread through the air. It is common; most children have antibodies by age 2–4. Most
common site is pulmonary, but infection may occur in extra-pulmonary sites as well
(e.g., skin, lymph nodes, spleen, brain)
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is first line for prophylaxis. It is low
cost, effective, and it has activity against toxoplasmosis and many bacterial infections
in addition to Pneumocystis jiroveci. If it is not tolerated due to rash, GI upset, or
fever, a desensitization protocol may be attempted
Indications for primary PCP prophylaxis
CD4 < 200 cells/mm3
HIV associated oral thrush
TMP/SMX initiation protocol: Tolerated better if started as a low dose (½ DS tab
every other day) and gradually increased
TMP/SMX desensitization: Very slow initiation may be attempted for patients who
had previous non-anaphylactic reactions to TMP/SMX
Patients who have CD4 count increase to > 200 for > 3 months may discontinue
primary PCP prophylaxis

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis
Common in food and water. Causes disease in up to 40% of late stage patients with
HIV infection who do not take MAC prophylaxis
Indications: CD4 < 50 cells/mm3
If Clarithromycin or Azithromycin (Macrolides are preferred agents) are used, then
screen for MAC first by obtaining a MAC culture. There is about a 27% incidence
of resistance to Macrolides in patients who develop MAC while on prophylaxis with
Macrolides
Patients who have CD4 count increase to > 100 for 3 months may discontinue primary
prophylaxis

Tuberculosis (See Chapter 41, Tuberculosis Screening)
Cryptococcus
Cryptococcus is a fungus, acquired by inhalation
Primary prophylaxis not recommended
CMV disease (retinitis)
CMV is a viral infection often causing blindness as a result of retinitis
Screening: Ophthalmologist exam every 6 months with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/
mm3 or visual symptoms
Primary prophylaxis not recommended
ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY—HIV enzymes can be inhibited with medications. The
viral load will return to detectable once medications are stopped or resistance develops
CLINICAL PEARLS
Using antiretrovirals during pregnancy can significantly decrease maternal transmission of
HIV to the fetus
Average fall in CD4 counts without therapy is about 50–80/year
CD4 counts and viral load both independently predict risk for HIV disease progression
Using both together can provide even more diagnostic information
Openness and honesty are paramount. Most AIDS patients will also be getting information
from sources other than their physician, including the internet and friends infected
with HIV. Desperation makes a believer out of a cynic. Ask your patients what other
interventions they are trying
