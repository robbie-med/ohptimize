48. CARDIAC STRESS TESTING
INDICATIONS FOR EXERCISE STRESS TESTING
(Does not apply to those who have had a recent MI). Before ordering, assess pretest and
posttest likelihood of a positive result. If a positive test on an asymptomatic patient will
be dismissed as a false positive, a stress test should not be performed. If a patient with
concerning symptoms and/or risk factors has a negative stress test but cardiac catheterization
will still be performed, consider proceeding directly to the catheterization
Initial evaluation in patients with suspected or known CAD
Patients with suspected or known CAD with a significant change in clinical status
Low risk unstable angina patients who have been symptom free for 8–12 hours
Intermediate risk unstable angina patients with normal cardiac markers for 12 hours after
onset of symptoms and normal repeat EKG
Stable patients undergoing periodic monitoring to guide treatment
Asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus who plan to start vigorous exercise
Asymptomatic men > 45 and women > 55 who
Plan to start vigorous exercise
Are in occupations where impairment might endanger public safety
Are at high risk for CAD due to other diseases (PVD, CRF)
Chronic aortic regurgitation with equivocal symptoms, before participation in exercise,
before valve replacement
Evaluation of exercise capacity in patients with valvular heart disease

TYPES OF EXERCISE AND OTHER TESTS
Exercise EKG: Exercise EKG alone without the addition of an imaging procedure is
useful for differentiating low- and high-risk patients with chest pain. The demonstration of
1.0mm or more of horizontal or down sloping ST segment depression at low exercise heart
rates or workloads is a significant predictor of an adverse outcome. A very rapid heart rate
recovery immediately after exercise was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular
disease events in the Framingham study
Advantages: Inexpensive, fast, objective assessment of exercise-induced symptoms
Disadvantages: Requires ability to exercise, reduced accuracy in patients with
abnormal baseline EKG, does not localize disease
Can be non-diagnostic in many situations: Resting ST-T wave abnormalities, LVH,
pre-excitation, Digoxin therapy, female gender (stress ECHO more cost-effective),
mitral valve prolapse, LBBB, ventricular pacer
Sensitivity 50–67% and specificity 72–90%
Stress ECHO: A positive test is based on the stress-induced presence of a regional
decrease in wall motion, a regional decrease in wall thickening, or regional compensatory
hyperkinesis. Cardiac stress may be induced with exercise or with pharmacologic agents.
Dobutamine is the preferred pharmacologic agent due to its greater effect on wall motion.
The diagnostic performance of stress Echo was recently reviewed by the ACC/AHA
Taskforce on Practice Guidelines. In general, its performance is highly comparable to that
of nuclear perfusion imaging. In 33 studies of exercise echocardiography, the weighted
mean sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 81%, respectively. Stress Echo has been
compared with nuclear perfusion imaging in several settings. A systematic review
compared the performance exercise nuclear perfusion SPECT imaging with exercise
echocardiography and found the sensitivity of the nuclear imaging superior (90% for
SPECT imaging versus 81% for echocardiography), while the specificity was superior for
echocardiography (89% for echocardiography versus 72% for SPECT imaging)
Advantages: No radiation exposure, less expensive/time-consuming than nuclear
scans, able to localize disease, identification of coronary territories of most concern,
results are immediately available, can assess valvular and aortic disease
Disadvantages: Interpretation is subjective, slightly lower sensitivity for CAD than
SPECT scanning, not a feasible test in 5–10% due to obesity or COPD
SPECT perfusion imaging: The major prognostic variables on stress perfusion images
predictive of future cardiac events are
A defect size > 20% of the left ventricle
207
LABS
Multiple perfusion abnormalities in 2 or more coronary supply regions suggestive
of multivessel CAD
Defect reversibility reflective of inducible ischemia in multiple myocardial
segments, even in the distribution of one major coronary artery
A large number of nonreversible defects
Transient left ventricular cavity dilation from stress to rest images
A resting left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40% measured on gated
SPECT
Nuclear imaging is the preferred modality for patients with expected suboptimal
ECHO windows, or with LBBB or pacer. Also preferred in those patients with prior
revascularization or prior MI
Sensitivity and specificity about 83–85% and specificity about 70–90%
Advantages
Localization of disease
Better able to identify “border zone” ischemia
Quantification of EF, can be combined with pharmacologic stress (vasodilators
such as Adenosine or Persantine have fewer side-effects than Dobutamine)
Provides prognostic information
Disadvantages
More expensive than stress ECHO
More time-intensive
Radiation exposure
Inability to assess myocardium or valves
Cardiac MRI
Currently useful for an assessment of congenital heart disease and diseases of the aorta
and pericardium
When compared with cardiac catheterization, MRI has both advantages and
disadvantages
Advantages
Noninvasive
Ability to measure flow and to map velocities through obstructive lesions
Ability to obtain tomographic views of complex three-dimensional anatomy.
In cases where shunting or stenoses of large vessels are concerned, especially
when these are combined with anatomical deformation, magnetic resonance with
velocity mapping can offer the surgeon more comprehensive information, more
safely and more economically than the catheter laboratory
No radiation exposure
Disadvantages
Pharmacologic stress only
Unable to measure pressure directly
It cannot readily measure oxygen saturation
Electron Beam Computed Tomography (EBCT)
Coronary calcium is a surrogate marker for coronary atherosclerotic plaque. In
the coronary arteries, calcifications occur almost exclusively in the context of
atherosclerotic changes
Within a coronary vessel or larger segment of the vessel, the quantity of coronary
calcium correlates moderately closely with the extent of atherosclerotic plaque
Coronary calcium can be detected in most patients with acute coronary syndrome, and
the amount of calcium in these patients is substantially greater than in matched control
subjects without coronary artery disease
Absence of coronary calcium makes the presence of significant coronary luminal
obstruction highly unlikely
Several cohort studies have shown that the presence of coronary calcium demonstrated
by EBT in asymptomatic individuals is a prognostic parameter with high predictive
power regarding the development of cardiac events during the following 3–5 years
208
LABS
Individuals who seem to be at intermediate risk for coronary events (0.6–2.0%
annual risk) based on traditional risk factor analysis will be most likely to profit from
noninvasive testing for subclinical atherosclerosis, such as the assessment of coronary
calcification
Not a true stress test—assesses for risk, but some patients may be amenable to this if
they refuse stress testing
CLINICAL PEARLS
Failure to achieve 80–85% of predicted maximum heart rate (or rate adjusted to MET
level) is associated with 84% increase in all cause mortality over the next 2 years
Abnormal heart rate recovery is associated with increased all cause mortality at 6 years
