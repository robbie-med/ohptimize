51. PROTEINURIA
DEFINITION
Normal excretion of protein in urine
≤150mg/day
Total protein excretion comprised of 5–15mg albumin, > 30 different plasma proteins,
and glycoproteins from distal tubule cells, i.e., Tamm-Horsfall protein (most prevalent,
excreted at 50–75mg/day)
“Pathologic” proteinuria: ≥150mg/day. Massive proteinuria is defined as > 3.5gm/day.
This leads to large albumin loss and other manifestations of nephrotic syndrome (edema,
hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia)
MECHANISM OF PROTEIN LOSS
Tubular/Overflow: Low-molecular weight proteins (β microglobulin, lysozyme, light
chains, insulin) are usually filtered by glomeruli and reabsorbed by tubules. If tubules are
damaged (tubular or interstitial disease), these proteins are excreted, usually in the range of
1–3g/24 hours. High serum protein levels can also “overwhelm” tubules and overflow into
urine (i.e., Bence-Jones protein associated with multiple myeloma)
Glomerular: Normal glomeruli filter little albumin or globulin. Glomerular disease
disrupts this barrier; excretion of mostly albumin on urine electrophoresis signifies a
glomerular lesion. Urinary excretion of > 2g/24 hours is usually a result of glomerular
disease
APPROACH TO EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT
If Dipstick > 1(+) proteinuria, then collect 24 hour urine
If proteinuria > 2g/24 hours
History: Pre-existing disease, HIV risk factors, systemic complaints (fatigue,
polydipsia, polyuria, back pain, joint pain, weight loss, rash), family history (diabetes,
polycystic kidney disease)
Physical exam: Blood pressure, weight, funduscopic exam, edema, skin and joint exam
(vasculitis/rheumatologic disease), ophthalmologic exam for diabetic retinopathy
Labs
Microscopic exam of urine sediment (casts, crystals)
Casts: Formed when proteins gel inside renal tubules, trapping WBCs and
RBCs
Hyaline casts: Found with concentrated urine, fever, diuretic use
RBC casts: Glomerulonephritis
WBC casts: Pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis
Renal tubular casts: ATN, interstitial nephritis
Coarse granular casts: Degeneration of cast with cellular elements, non-
specific
Broad waxy casts: Chronic renal failure. Stasis in collecting tubule
Crystals: Should be visualized when urine is freshly voided and still warm.
Uric acid, phosphate, and oxalate crystals are seen in normal patients as well
as stone formers
BUN and creatinine, CBC
Serum protein immunoelectrophoresis (SPE) to identify any paraproteins in
the serum which could be overwhelming the tubules. Obtain urine protein
electrophoresis simultaneously to quantify the amount of each protein type in the
urine (important to consider in patient age > 40)
217
LABS
ANA, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3 and C4) to
screen for vasculitis as etiology of glomerular damage (depending on patient’s
associated symptoms)
HIV test
Blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c
Blood cultures: Screen for subacute bacterial endocarditis (only symptom may be
proteinuria and/or hematuria)
If proteinuria < 2g/24 hours
History: Recent fever, increase in exercise, other systemic complaints (back pain or
other bone pain, fatigue) to screen for multiple myeloma
Physical exam: Same as above
Labs: Same as above
Transient proteinuria
Associated with fever, stress, exercise (within last 48 hours)
Recheck after confounding factors have resolved
If < 150mg/24 hours, then no work-up
If > 150mg/24 hours, then check yearly BP, UA, and Cr
Orthostatic proteinuria: Usually a benign process
< 1g/24 hours; if greater, should consider other etiologies
More common in children and adolescents
Can obtain urine dipstick on first void in AM, then check again after patient has
been upright for 2 hours. Or do a split 24 hour urine collection (16 hours daytime
specimen and an 8 hours overnight specimen)
Should follow yearly BP, UA, and creatinine, especially in children
Nephrotic syndrome
Definition: Proteinuria > 3.0–3.5g/24 hours, or spot urine protein: creatinine ratio >
3.0–3.5, hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 3.0g/dL), edema, and hyperlipidemia
(elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides)
Common end point due to a variety of disease processes such as DM, amyloidosis,
SLE, idiopathic, or primary renal disease such as focal glomerular sclerosis, minimal
change disease, etc.
Arises due to an alteration in the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall
Common to all diseases causing nephrotic syndrome is the presence of oval fat bodies
seen on microscopic exam of urine; caused by degenerating tubular epithelial cells
filled with cholesterol esters. Under polarized light will appear as “Maltese Crosses”
Loss of antithrombin III and other proteins can lead to a hypercoagulable state,
particularly venous involvement (DVT, PE, renal vein thrombosis)
SPECIFIC DISEASES
Diabetes mellitus
Most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Higher incidence
of renal complications in Hispanic, Black/African American, and Native American
populations
20–30% risk of developing diabetic nephropathy
Early renal changes of increased GFR, increased renal blood flow, and renal
hypertrophy can be reversed with good glycemic control. Sustained hyperglycemia and
HbA1c > 9 correlates with hyperfiltration and hypertrophy
Recommendation: Yearly urine microalbuminuria screening. Allows for detection
of small amounts of albumin which are not detected on routine urine dipstick test.
Persistent or increasing microalbuminuria indicates early diabetic nephropathy
If urine albumin: Creatinine ratio is > 30, testing should be repeated in 6 months.
Persistently elevated albumin:creatinine ratio or GFR< 60 for more than 3 months
is diagnostic of diabetic kidney disease. ACE inhibitor should be initiated in both
hypertensive and normotensive Type 1 diabetic patients with urine microalbuminuria.
Blood pressure should be aggressively reduced to < 130/80. Check creatinine and
potassium 1 week after initiating ACE inhibitor. In hypertensive Type 2 diabetic
218
LABS
patients with microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay
progression to macroalbuminuria; ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of
nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and macroalbuminuria
SGLT-2 Inhibitors are recommended with metformin as first line treatment of
hyperglycemia if GFR > 30 due to benefits in preventing CKD progression and CVD
Blood glucose should also be aggressively controlled to delay progression to persistent
proteinuria
Microalbuminuria is highly predictive for subsequent retinopathy development
Hypertension
Hypertensive patients constitute 20% of the dialysis population. The two groups at
highest risk for hypertensive ESRD are blacks of all ages and the elderly
A complete urinalysis should be performed yearly on all hypertensive patients. If
positive for protein, a 24 hour urine should be obtained. Other causes of proteinuria
should also be considered. In addition to aggressive blood pressure management,
patient should follow a no-added salt restriction
Medications: Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are most beneficial for patients with renal
damage secondary to hypertension
Consider renal artery stenosis as a possible diagnosis in elderly hypertensives with
unexplained deterioration of renal function
CLINICAL PEARLS
In patients with proteinuria and altered renal function, try to avoid NSAIDs
Smoking cessation has been shown to decrease albumin excretion
When to refer to a nephrologist: Proteinuria greater than 1g/24 hours, unless the etiology is
known (i.e., diabetes mellitus) and already being aggressively treated
Proteinuria on initial dipstick analysis is found in as high as 17% of selected populations;
< 2% have serious and treatable urinary tract disorders
