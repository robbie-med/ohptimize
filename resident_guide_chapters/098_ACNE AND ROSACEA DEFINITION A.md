98. ACNE AND ROSACEA
DEFINITION
Acne vulgaris: Chronic inflammation of the pilosebaceous units, caused by increased
sebum production, abnormal follicles, propionibacterium, and hormonal and
immunological factors
Rosacea: Chronic acneform inflammation of the pilosebaceous units of the face coupled
with an increased reactivity of the capillaries to heat, leading to flushing and telangiectasias
Special forms of acne include
Acne conglobata: Severe cystic acne with coalescing nodules, cysts and abscesses
Acne fulminans: Acute, severe suppurative cystic acne with fever and generalized
arthritis
— PART ONE: ACNE VULGARIS —
ETIOLOGY
Caused by Propionibacterium
Endocrine
Premenstrual and androgenic disorders such as polycystic ovary, or Cushing’s
syndrome
Menstrual irregularities
Hirsutism
Environment
Humidity
Excessive sweating
Working in an environment with aerosolized fats (i.e., fast-foods)
Mechanical
Pressure
Constant rubbing of clothes
Picking/squeezing: May lead to scarring and worsening
Washing with harsh soaps, excessive scrubbing
Cosmetics
Medications: Steroids, ACTH, androgens, Dilantin, barbiturates, Lithium, Isoniazid,
Cyclosporine, iodides and bromides, oral contraceptives with strong androgens and/or anti-
estrogenic activity

HISTORY
Duration
Previous successful and unsuccessful therapies
Relation to menses
Presence of hirsutism
Cleansing habits (vigorous scrubbing, etc.), cosmetics
Mechanical factors: Tight clothing, constant rubbing of clothes, picking and squeezing
Medications
Seasonal prevalence: Often worse in fall and winter
Diet: No firm studies link diet to acne, but patients may notice worsening of acne after
eating certain foods
PHYSICAL EXAM
Comedones: Sebum clogged sebaceous follicles, open (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads)
Pustules: Erupting follicular contents
Papules: Inflammatory raised lesions in dermis
Cysts: Deep, intense inflammatory papule progressing to fluctuant, painful area
Seborrhea may also be seen
Inspect face, back, chest and buttocks for lesions and scarring
Severity: To guide treatment
Type 1: Mild—Inflammatory acne: Comedonal, less than 10 lesions, face only, no
scarring
Type 2: Mild—Papular acne: Less than 25 lesions, face and trunk, mild scarring
Type 3: Moderate—Pustular acne: More than 25 lesions with moderate scarring
Type 4: Severe—Cystic acne: Nodulocystic with extensive scarring

General
Wash with mild soap (e.g., Dial, Ivory, Phisoderm, PanOxyl, Neutrogena)
If any of the above factors (listed in etiology) are contributing to a worsening of
acne, then modify as needed. Avoid foods noted to cause flare-ups, avoid mechanical
pressure, vigorous cleansing, etc.
Medications: Topical (Table 1)
Salicylic acid: Available OTC as cream, gel, and cleansers for mild acne. It can be
used in combination with other topical agents
Benzoyl Peroxide Most useful for treatment of mild to moderate acne. Apply to clean,
dry skin at bedtime or BID. Available in OTC and prescription preparations and in a
variety of concentrations and formulations. Common preparations are 5% and 10% as
gel, cream, lotion, and liquid. The liquid and cream are less irritating and gel is better
for oily skin. It is often used in combination with topical or oral antibiotics, or with a
retinoid. Skin irritation and bleaching can occur
Topical retinoids: Tretinoin, Adapalene, Tazarotene
439
DERM
Retinoids normalize keratinization and have anti-inflammatory effects. They are
effective for all types and severity of acnes
Apply a pea-size amount to cover the entire face once daily at bedtime. Available
in a variety of formulations. Use cream for dry skin. Side-effects include burning,
stinging, dryness, and scaling. These can be reduced by starting therapy with the
lowest strength. Avoid sun exposure
Tretinoin (Retin-A, generic): Simultaneous application of Tretinoin and Benzoyl
Peroxide can cause oxidation of Tretinoin and decrease its effectiveness. In
combination therapy, apply Benzoyl Peroxide in the morning and Tretinoin in the
evening. Pregnancy Category C
Adapalene (Differin): Photostable and can be used with Benzoyl Peroxide in a
fixed-combination products. Pregnancy Category C
Tazarotene (Tazorac): More irritation than Adapalene. Pregnancy Category X
Topical antibiotics
Topical Clindamycin and Erythromycin are commonly used to treat mild to
moderate acne. They are not recommended as monotherapy because of slow onset
of action and emergence of antibiotic resistance. If topical antibiotic treatment
is used for more than a few weeks, Benzoyl Peroxide should be added. Fixed-
combination products containing Benzoyl Peroxide are available
Dapsone is an antimicrobial drug. Studies showed that topical Dapsone is most
effective against inflammatory acnes. Application of both topical Dapsone
and Benzoyl Peroxide at the same time can cause temporary yellow or orange
discoloration of the skin. Pregnancy Category C
Azelaic Acid: An anti-keratinizing agent with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory
activity. Less irritating than Benzoyl Peroxide. Can cause hypopigmentation,
particularly in people with dark skin. Pregnancy Category B
Medication: Oral (Table 2)
Oral antibiotics are appropriate for moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris.
Avoid antibiotic monotherapy. Use in combination with a topical regimen that includes
Benzoyl Peroxide. Discontinue or taper antibiotic within 1 to 2 months once new
inflammatory acne lesions have stopped emerging. Incorporate a topical Retinoid or
combination Retinoid/Benzoyl Peroxide product into the regimen when discontinuing
oral antibiotic with goal of maintaining control with topical program. If retreatment is
needed, use the same oral antibiotic. Educate patients on side-effects of the antibiotic
Tetracycline, Doxycycline, and Minocycline should not be used in pregnant
women and children aged < 8 years
Erythromycin: High prevalence of antibiotic-resistant P acnes
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim): Not generally recommended for use
as first or second line agent. Use judiciously in selected refractory cases. Side-
effects include toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bone
marrow suppression, hypersensitivity reactions, rash. Obtain CBC at baseline and
periodically thereafter
Oral Isotretinoin
Isotretinoin targets all pathophysiologic factors involved in acne. It is very
effective for severe nodulocystic acne. It reduces sebum production
Start the dose at 0.5mg/kg/day given BID for 4 weeks, then increase to the full
dosage of 1mg/kg/day. Treatment usually lasts 4–5 months
Many adverse reactions including dermatologic, CNS, endocrine, GI, and
musculoskeletal side-effects (Table 2)
The major adverse effect is its teratogenic potential
The FDA implemented a computer-based risk management program
(iPLEDGE) which registers all Isotretinoin patients, physicians, pharmacies,
and manufacturers
The prescriber must register each patient in iPLEDGE. In addition, the
prescriber must confirm patient counseling. For female of childbearing
potential, the prescriber must enter the 2 contraception methods and pregnancy
440
DERM
test results on a monthly basis. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a
pharmacy registered and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed
to patients who are registered and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE
Oral Isotretinoin should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in
the uses of this very potent drug
Systemic hormonal therapy
Combination oral contraceptives (COCs) block the effects of androgens on the
sebaceous gland
Use COCs with low estrogen dose. Products approved by the FDA for the
treatment of moderate acne in women are Estrostep for age ≥15 years, Ortho Tri-
Cyclen for age ≥15 years, YAZ and Beyaz for age ≥14 years
Obtain a family history of thrombotic events and ask if the patient smokes before
OCs are prescribed
COCs may be useful as second-line therapy in pubertal females with moderate-
to-severe acne. Because of concerns about growth and bone density, many
experts recommend withholding COC for acne unassociated with endocrinologic
pathology until 1 year after onset of menstruation
Spironolactone is a synthetic steroidal androgen receptor blocker. It is used off-
label to treat acne in women. Dosages of 50–200mg have been used. Side-effects
include hyperkalemia, orthostatic hypotension, menstrual irregularity, breast
tenderness, and reduced libido. Pregnancy Category C
Phototherapy: Blue light, infrared lasers, photodynamic therapy and other light-based
therapies have been used for the treatment of acne. Their long-term efficacy and how they
compare to conventional drugs are unclear
Treatment failure: If treatment fails, consider dermatology referral due to the serious
side-effects of the latter therapies and the risk of scarring

— PART TWO: ROSACEA —
HISTORY
Usually ages 30–50
Females > Males
Celtic/Northern Europeans much more than pigmented races
Hot liquids/heat may stimulate or worsen, alcohol increases flushing
Emotional stress may be a factor
Rosacea has now been associated with H. pylori. Treatment of H. pylori disease has
improved co-existing rosacea
PHYSICAL EXAM
Flushing
Papular and papulopustular lesions
Telangiectasias
Nodules
Absence of comedones
Usually present on the face only: cheeks, chin, forehead, nose and rarely neck
Associated rhinophyma
Blepharitis, episcleritis and conjunctivitis may occur
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Ethanol use, pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis,
carcinoid tumor, Marfan’s syndrome, homocystinuria
MANAGEMENT
Decrease alcohol and hot beverage intake
Topical
443
DERM
Metronidazole 0.75% (MetroGel, MetroCream): Apply BID to clean, dry skin; or 1%
gel (MetroGel), 1% cream (Noritate): Apply once daily. May take 4–8 weeks
Azelaic Acid: Only 15% gel (Finacea) is approved for rosacea; 20% cream (Azelex) is
for acne. Apply twice daily
Sodium Sulfacetamide 10%/Sulfur 5% (Plexion): Apply once daily
Benzoyl Peroxide (2.5%, 5%, 10%) once or twice daily
Persistent symptoms: Tretinoin Cream (Retin-A 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%) in patients with
papular or pustular lesions not responsive to the above topical treatment. Start with
0.025% 2–3 ×/week and gradually increase at bedtime
Systemic: If topical fails, then consider oral Doxycycline 100mg PO BID or Minocycline
100mg PO BID. Doses may be decreased after response. A low-dose (40mg) Doxycycline
in a regular and slow-release formulation (Oracea) is now available. Take 1 capsule (40mg)
once daily in the morning on an empty stomach. Very expensive
Avoid sun
CLINICAL PEARLS
About 50% of patients with rosacea have ocular involvement with irritation, chalazia, styes
or corneal damage
Blepharitis can often be cleared with simple lid scrubs with baby shampoo and PO
Tetracycline
