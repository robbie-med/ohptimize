108. SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION
— PART ONE: MALE —
INTRODUCTION
Definition: Consistent inability to achieve and/or maintain an erect penis which is ad-
equate for satisfactory sexual performance
Affects 15–25% males > 65. About 80% of cases are secondary to organic disease. Affects
10–30 million men in US
May have negative impact on self-esteem, relationships, and quality of life
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Psychogenic: e.g., Performance anxiety, stress or relationship discord, anxiety/depression,
etc.
Organic
Vasculogenic: Most common are arterial/inflow problems (e.g., DM, CAD, etc.)
Neurogenic: e.g., Spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, herniated disc, etc.
Hormonal: e.g., Hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, hypo/hyper-thyroidism
Mechanical: Peyronie’s disease, anatomic abnormalities
Iatrogenic
Medications (See III. F. below)
Environmental: e.g., Alcohol, cigarettes, drugs of abuse

HISTORY
Techniques to initiate discussion of sexual topics in a nonthreatening manner
Consider asking: Many men (with diabetes, CHF, etc.) experience sexual problems.
Has this happened to you?
Are you currently sexually active? Do you or your partner have any sexual issues that
you would like to discuss?
Distinguish loss of libido vs. loss of erections: If libido and erections are intact, the cause
is usually psychogenic
Onset and duration of impotence: Gradual loss of erections over time suggests organic
cause
Erections: Difficulty in obtaining or maintaining erections and presence of nocturnal
erections. If normal erections do occur, then the cause is usually psychogenic
Past medical history: Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis, neurologic
disease, thyroid disorders, renal failure, adrenal disorders
Medications
Antihypertensives
Thiazides, Spironolactone
Sympatholytics: Methyldopa (Aldomet), Clonidine (Catapres), Reserpine,
α-blockers
β-blockers (especially non-selective β-blockers)
485
PSYCH
Psychiatric medications: Tricyclics, SSRIs, MAOIs, anxiolytics (Benzodiazepines)
Antiandrogens: Digoxin, histamine H2 receptor blockers
Others: Ketoconazole (Nizoral), Niacin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin (Dilantin), anabolic
steroids, corticosteroids, Finasteride (Proscar), Gemfibrozil (Lopid)
Drugs: Alcohol, nicotine, illicit drug use. Male erectile disorder 85% greater in smokers
Past surgical history: Pelvic surgery or spinal cord injury
Social history: Recent divorce, death of a spouse, new partner, marital/relationship
discord, history of sexual abuse, increased stress (job change, move, death or illness in
family, new baby, new diagnosis of concerning medical condition), substance, tobacco, or
alcohol use
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Overt appearance/dress/speech may show signs of anxiety or depression
Vascular disease: Check blood pressure, auscultate vessels for bruits, signs of HTN or
ischemic heart disease, lack of hair on legs may indicate peripheral vascular disease
Secondary sexual characteristics: Masculinization, beard, and body hair changes
Neurological exam: Peripheral sensory exam plus other (See rectal exam)
Genital: Penile scarring or plaque formation (Peyronie’s disease), hypospadias, phimosis,
hypogonadism, testicular abnormalities, tunics and erectile tissue
Rectal
Prostate exam (DRE)
Check rectal tone
Superficial anal reflex (to assess sacral cord function—perform by touching perianal
skin and note contraction of external anal sphincter muscles
Bulbocavernosus reflex (to assess sacral cord function—perform by placing a finger
in the rectum and then squeeze the glans penis and noting contraction of the anal
sphincter and bulbocavernosus muscle)
Consider psychological evaluation—especially if younger male
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS (If necessary after history and physical
exam): See flow chart in link above
Labs: CBC, chemistry, glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, PSA, testosterone, thyroid function
tests, urinalysis
If testosterone is abnormal: Check FSH, LH, prolactin
Nocturnal penile tumescence testing: If erections are obtained, this suggests psychogenic
etiology. Test is not necessary if the history indicates that patient has erections
Injection of vasoactive substance into penis: If results in erection, vascular cause is
excluded; also done to determine therapeutic options
Color Doppler ultrasonography: If there is a suggestion of vascular disease
TREATMENT OF ORGANIC IMPOTENCE (Listed in increasing order of invasiveness):
For treatment of psychogenic impotence, refer to other sources
Minimize medications with side-effects of sexual dysfunction, or change to a different
class of agents
Smoking cessation, alcohol in moderation, healthy diet, regular exercise
Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors: First-line agents. Increase penile cGMP,
resulting in relaxation of smooth muscle cells
Four drugs available: Sildenafil (Viagra), Vardenafil (Levitra), Tadalafil (Cialis),
Avanafil (Stendra)
All have similar efficacy. A meta-analysis of 14 trials showed that 83% of men taking
Sildenafil had a successful intercourse as compared to 45% men taking placebo
Pharmacokinetic differences: Both Sildenafil, Vardenafil, and Avanafil have half-
lives of 4–5 hours, but the half-life of Tadalafil is 17.5 hours. Unlike Sildenafil and
Vardenafil, absorption of Tadalafil and Avanafil are not affected by a fatty meal
Contraindicated in patients with high or intermediate risk of coronary artery disease or
with concurrent nitrate use (nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate)
486
PSYCH
Side-effects are similar in all 4 drugs: Headache, flushing, nasal congestion, dyspep-
sia, myalgia, vision disturbances and rare cases of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic
neuropathy (NAION) causing sudden vision loss. Acute hearing loss has also been
reported
Drug interactions: Can cause hypotension when use with α-blockers. CYP3A4 in-
hibitors (e.g., Protease Inhibitors, Macrolides, Azoles) increase PDE5 inhibitors serum
concentration
For as-needed use: Instruct patient to take medication 1 hour before anticipated sexual
activity. Medication should not be used more than once per 24 hours
Sildenafil (Viagra): Initial dose 50mg, may increase to 100mg
Vardenafil (Levitra): Initial dose 10mg, may increase to 20mg
Tadalafil (Cialis): Initial dose 10mg, may increase to 20mg
Avanafil (Stendra): Initial dose 100mg, may increase to 200mg
Cialis has recently been approved for once-daily treatment (2.5mg daily, may increase
to 5mg daily if needed)
Prostaglandin E1 (Alprostadil): Increases the concentration of cAMP and decreases
intracellular calcium concentration, resulting in relaxation of smooth-muscle cells
Intraurethral suppository (MUSE): Supervise initial application. Initially, 125 or
250mcg suppository is inserted into urethra after urination. May adjust dose in
stepwise increments on separate occasion. Maximum 2 suppositories/day
Intracavernosal injection (Caverject): Supervise initial self-injection. Start with 2.5mcg
dose and adjust dose on separate visit. Maximum ≤3 ×/week, with at least 24 hours
between doses
Testosterone-replacement therapy: Used in men with whom a low bioavailable
testosterone level has been confirmed
Evaluate after 1 to 3 months and at least annually thereafter for testosterone levels,
erectile function, and adverse effects
Commonly used dosage forms are
IM injection: Depo-Testosterone (testosterone cypionate in oil): 100mg every
week or 200–300mg every 2–3 weeks
Transdermal patch (Androderm): 1× 4mg/day applied nightly for 24 hours to
upper arms, thighs, back or abdomen
Topical gel:
AndroGel 1.62%: Start at 40.5mg (2 pumps, or 1× 40.5mg packet) once daily
in the morning. Apply to shoulders and upper arms
AndroGel 1%: Start at 50mg (4 pumps, 2 × 25mg packets, or 1 × 50mg
packet) once daily in the morning. Apply to shoulders and upper arms
Fortesta 2%: Start at 40mg (4 pumps) once daily in the morning. Apply to
thighs
Testim: Start at 50mg (1 tube) once daily. Apply to shoulders and/or upper
arms
Topical spray: Axiron 60mg (1 pump actuation of 30mg to each axilla) applied
once daily in the morning
Buccal tablet: Striant 30mg (1 buccal system) to the gum region twice daily,
morning and evening
Implant: Testopel 75mg pellet: 150 to 450mg SC every 3 to 6 months. Less dosing
flexibility
Oral tab (Methyltestosterone, Fluoxymesterone) should not be used due to risk of
hepatotoxicity
Adverse effects: Skin reactions with patch, gynecomastia, sleep apnea, exacerbate
BPH, prostate cancer, reduced HDL-C, erythrocytosis, LFT elevation, and reduced
fertility
Yohimbine: Available as a dietary supplement. No efficacy data found
It blocks presynaptic α2A-adrenergic receptors, resulting in increased penile blood
flow
Dose: 5.4mg PO TID
487
PSYCH
Side-effects: Increased urinary output, elevated blood pressure and heart rate,
increased motor activity, nervousness, irritability, and tremor
Vacuum erection devices: Consist of a hollow cylinder placed over the penis, a vacuum
is generated and a rubber ring is rolled onto the erect penis to the base to trap blood
maintaining the erection. Can be uncomfortable and may be associated with ecchymosis
Penile prosthetic device: Surgically implanted into the penis. Two types of prostheses:
Malleable and inflatable. Consider after less invasive treatment failed
Psychotherapy: Useful for patients in whom erectile dysfunction has psychogenic or
social components
— PART TWO: FEMALE —

the physician during the history. Estimated that 19–50% of women have at least occasional
sexual dysfunction
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Inhibited arousal
Orgasmic dysfunction
Pain with sexual intercourse: Dyspareunia/vaginismus
HISTORY
Family background: Repressive background/upbringing
Onset and duration: Primary vs. secondary
Relationship to stage of sexual intercourse: Problems with lack of adequate lubrication,
pain with deep thrusting (if this is causing the cervix to be moved it may indicate infection,
pelvic mass, etc.)
Trauma: Rape, abusive relationship, sexual abuse or incest (childhood or adult)
Sexual orientation
Life changes in the past year: Losses, pregnancy, stresses
Relationship with sexual partner(s): New partner, marital/relationship discord,
inexperience, inhibition
Menarche/menopause
Pregnancy or postpartum
Past medical history: Chronic illness, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, cancer
Drugs: Alcohol, nicotine, IV drugs
Medications
Psychoactive medications: e.g., BDZ, SSRIs, MAOIs, TCAs
Cardiovascular and antihypertensives: e.g., β-blockers, Clonidine, Digoxin,
Spironolactone, anti-lipids, Methyldopa (Aldomet)
Hormonal preparations: Danazol, OCPs, GnRH agonists (Lupron, Synarel)
Anticholinergics
Antihistamines
Others: Ketoconazole (Nizoral), Phenytoin (Dilantin), histamine H2 receptor blockers
Past surgical history: Pelvic surgery (number and type) or spinal cord injury
Hormonal changes: Postpartum, breast-feeding
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Vital signs for HTN and signs of ischemic heart disease or other chronic medical
condition
Genital: Discharge, vulvar dystrophy, dermatitis, vaginismus, ulcerations (HSV)
Surgical changes: Female circumcision, clitoral adhesions, episiotomy
Pelvic exam: Adnexal tenderness and signs of endometriosis such as uterosacral
nodularity and decreased pelvic organ mobility
Rectal exam: Rectocele, infections/ulcerations, mass, blood/heme testing
488
PSYCH
MANAGEMENT: Treat secondary factors first and/or concurrently with the interventions
listed below
Decreased libido: See Table below in link, C. 3
Estrogen replacement therapy if postmenopausal (or with surgical menopause)
The short-term addition of androgens has been helpful in some women in restoring
sexual desire
If secondary to relationship or marital strife, address these problems or refer for
therapy. Address other aspects (listed in history) including religious taboos, social
restrictions, sexual identity conflicts, guilt, history of abuse, inexperience, stressors
Consider altering or prolonging arousal phase, use of erotic materials, interventions to
reduce anxiety
Orgasmic problems
Primary anorgasmia (never experienced orgasm in any situation)
Causes: May be due to fear of pregnancy, satisfaction, losing control. Anxiety is
often a factor
Treatment
Usually very successful
Extinguish the woman’s subconscious over control and enhance sensory
stimulation
Focus on erotic thoughts and fantasies. Consider “spectatoring” (observing
oneself from a third-party perspective)
Self-stimulation or prolonged stimulation with partner (up to 1hour). Consider
use of a vibrator
Heighten arousal and lubrication before penetration
Secondary anorgasmia
In-depth exploration of differences in life situation now and in the past (when she
was able to obtain an orgasm)
Use the above techniques
Dyspareunia
Superficial: Occurs with attempted penetration. May be due to irritative conditions
such as infections/dermatitis or to vaginismus
Vaginismus is painful reflex spasm of the perivaginal muscles due to fear of sex
(young and inexperienced, often from strict homes) or prior rape or incest
May be complete (occurs whenever there is penetration) or situational
Gradual muscle relaxation and vaginal dilation. Have patient alternatively
relax and contract pelvic muscles. Vaginal dilation may be with patient’s finger,
partner’s finger, or commercial dilator (may use tampon). Success rates close to
90%
Psychotherapy
Vaginal: Pain related to friction and often secondary to irritation from inadequate
vaginal lubrication (may be physiologic or from decreased arousal)
Consider trial of prolonged arousal phase
Lubricants such as K-Y jelly, Lubrin, Replens
Vaginal creams containing estrogen can reverse vaginal atrophy in peri-
menopausal women
Low dose oral contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy can alleviate
vaginal dryness
Deep: Pain related to thrusting, often from pelvic disease
Endometriosis
Ovarian cysts/mass
May require further work-up
489
PSYCH
CLINICAL PEARLS
Premature ejaculation is usually psychogenic (performance anxiety)
40% of men in their 40’s report occasional difficulty in obtaining or maintaining an
erection, this number rises to 70% at 70
At 60, men have an average of 1 erection per week
Most patients feel that sexual function is an appropriate topic to be addressed by their
primary care providers
8–10% of adult women in the U.S. have never had an orgasm. 10% achieve orgasm with
fantasy alone
