26. CONTRACEPTION
ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES (OCS)
OCs act by suppression of ovulation and thickening of cervical mucus
Advantages
Theoretical and actual failure rates of 0.5% and 3% respectively
Decreased risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer by 40% and 50%, respectively
Decreased risk of ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
Lighter menstrual flow, relief of dysmenorrhea, decreased ovarian cysts
Decreased endometriosis, PMS symptoms and acne
Decreased incidence of fibrocystic breast disease and fibroadenoma
Fertility returns within 3 months of discontinuing OCs in most patients
Decreased perimenopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor instability (low-dose
estrogen)
Contraindications (to Estrogen-containing OCs)
Absolute
Pregnancy
Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders past or present
CVA, CAD, or structural heart disease
Breast cancer or Estrogen-dependent cancer (some feel this is a relative
contraindication)
Liver disease
Relative
Age > 35 and smoker
Hypertension, uncontrolled on appropriate medical therapy
Cardiac, renal, gallbladder disease
Migraines, with focal neurologic symptoms
Postpartum < 21 days or lactation (avoid OCPs until lactation well-established);
See I. and J. below
Diabetes, surgery, fracture, severe injury (prolonged bedrest with increased risk of
DVT), lactation, significant depression
Drug interactions: Patients taking the following drugs will need to use another form of
contraception: Rifampin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin (Dilantin), Griseofulvin, Primidone
(Mysoline), Carbamazepine (Tegretol), St. John’s Wort, and antibiotics (if using ultra-low
dose products). OCs can also decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs, resulting in
increased toxicity (some Benzodiazepines, β-blockers, Theophylline, TCAs). Pioglitazone
(Actos) and Ethosuximide can decrease effectiveness
Follow-up: Return 3 months after beginning OCs to have blood pressure checked. Inquire
about side-effects, spotting, failure to withdrawal bleed (See following Tables). Then
follow-up every year. Perform Pap screening and check fasting lipids according to age-
related guidelines
Initiation of OCs: Check pregnancy test first and use back-up method of contraception for
first 7 days with Quick Start and Sunday Start
Quick start: May be started anytime during cycle but preferred approach is the “Quick
start” where they are started same day as prescription
Sunday start: Begin first Sunday after beginning of menstruation
First Day start: Begin pill on first day of menstruation. No back-up method needed
Age > 35
96
OB-GYN
Smokers: Discontinue OCs or change to progesterone only pill
If patient is a non-smoker and blood pressure, lipids, and fasting blood sugar are
within normal limits, then OCs may be continued until menopause. Use a low dose
(20mcg Ethinyl Estradiol) OC if patient > age 40, e.g., Loestrin 1/20
Women > age 45 on OCs should have FSH checked every year (on 6th day of a 7-day
pill-free interval) and be changed to Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) when FSH
> 30
Missed pills
1 missed pill: Take as soon as patient remembers, take next pill on schedule, no back-
up required
2 missed pills: Take 2 pills on each of next 2 days and use a back-up for 7 days
3 missed pills: Continue to take pills and use back-up until menstruation
Amenorrhea while taking OCs
For 1–2 cycles: Check β-hCG
For 3 cycles: Increase estrogen or decrease progestin
Postpartum
Progestin-only contraception (pills, DMPA, implants) can be initiated immediately
after delivery in nonlactating women (CDC, WHO). There is an increase in volume
and duration of vaginal bleeding if progestin-only contraception started prior to 6
weeks postpartum
Women in the first 6 weeks of postpartum period have a 22-fold to 84-fold increased
risk for VTE. Therefore estrogen-containing OCs should not be used in women who
are < 6 weeks after delivery, especially in women who had other risk factors for VTE
(CDC, WHO)
Postpartum and breastfeeding
Progestin-only contraception (pills, DMPA, implants) can be initiated at 6 weeks
postpartum in women who are breastfeeding (ACOG, WHO)
Estrogen-containing OCs do not cause infant developmental problems but may cause
a decrease in milk production. Use of estrogen OCs in women who are > 6 weeks
postpartum is reasonable if the benefits outweigh the risks (CDC)
Postponing menstruation: Often desired for wedding, vacation. Patient should omit the 7
day hormone-free interval. She should start a new pack the day after finishing the 21 active
pills
Pregnancy occurring while on OCs: Using OCs during early pregnancy does not appear
to increase the risk of fetal deformities. The OC should be stopped after pregnancy is
diagnosed
Types of oral contraceptives
Estrogen-Progestin combination
Two most commonly used Estrogen compounds are Ethinyl Estradiol (EE) or
Mestranol. Mestranol is estimated to be 50% less potent than EE
Progestin component in OCs varies in both dose and type, leading to differences
in pharmacologic effect. Most OCs contain Norethindrone, Ethynodiol, and
Levonorgestrel
Newer progestins: Norgestimate and Desogestrel offer reduced androgenic activity
Drospirenone is a progestin derived from spironolactone. It possesses
antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid activity
The combination of lower androgenicity and diuretic effect may be
particularly effective for patients suffering premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
nausea, fluid retention, and acne
Given the potential for hyperkalemia, use with caution in patients with
impaired renal or adrenal function. Monitor for interactions with drugs such as
ACE inhibitors, ARBs K+ sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs
The FDA issued safety alert on the possible increased risk of blood clots with
drospirenone-containing OCs (1.5 × ) compared to users of other hormonal
contraceptives. (FDA Drug Safety Announcement 9/26/12)
97
OB-GYN
Conventional OCs contain 30–35mcg EE and a progestin that is less androgenic
(Norgestimate or Desogestrel)
Low estrogen (20 or 25mcg): Progestin combinations are available
Regimens
Monophasic OCs: Constant dose of estrogen and progestin in the active pills
per cycle
Biphasic, triphasic, 4-phasic OCs: Dose of estrogen and progestin vary in
the active pills in 2 or 3 phases. These types of OCs attempt to duplicate
the pattern of a normal menstrual cycle. Clinically, very little difference is
observed between monophasic and multiphasic OCs
Conventional regimen: 28-day cycle (21 days of active pills followed by 7 day
medication free)
24/4 regimen: 24-day on and 4-day off cycle
Extended-cycle: 84-days of active pills followed by 7 days of placebo
Continuous: used for certain disorders such as endometriosis, premenstrual
dysphoric disorder, hyperandrogenism
In some formulations, placebo tablets may be replaced with:
aa. Ferrous fumarate to facilitate ease of administration (e.g., Loestrin Fe)
bb. Levomefolate to reduce the risk of neural tube defects if pregnancy occurs
during or shortly after use (e.g., Beyaz)
Progestin-only products (“mini-pills”)
Contain decreased dose of Progestin relative to combination OCs
Preferred for use during breastfeeding, and for women who have contraindication
to estrogens (especially smokers > age 35)
Have a slightly higher failure rate (1–4%) and may lead to more irregular bleeding
Best efficacy if taken at same time of day

5Yaz also has an indication for the treatment of PMDD
6Additional indication for acne
7Additional indication for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Failure rates with the Progestin-only minipill are higher than other OCs (1–4%). They also
do not offer protection against functional ovarian cysts
Ethynodiol, Desogestrel and Norgestimate have a low amount of androgenicity and may be
good first line agents for women with acne and hirsutism
Some clinicians feel that assessing the relative progesterone potency is not clinically useful
PROGESTERONE IMPLANTS AND INJECTIONS
Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate) 150mg IM every 3 months (11–13
weeks)
Failure rate of 0.2% first year; cumulative 3-year 0.7%
Check urine pregnancy test before administering first dose. Should also check urine
pregnancy before re-administering Depo-Provera if patient > 1 week late for injection
If first dose is given during menstruation, contraception begins immediately. If not,
then use alternate form of contraception until next menses
May give postpartum even if mothers are lactating
Side-effects: Irregular bleeding, amenorrhea, weight gain (5–10lbs), headache,
increased risk of bone loss with long-term use, breast tenderness, depression,
irritability
100
OB-GYN
If spotting occurs, patient should be informed that irregular bleeding usually
disappears after 1 year. Consider giving Premarin 1.25mg daily × 7 days which may be
increased to 2.5mg daily × 7 days or 2.5mg daily × 21 days. This therapy should not
be continued longer than 1–2 months. If unsuccessful then consider another form of
contraception
Disadvantage: Delayed return to fertility, average 10 months
Useful for patients with seizure disorder, sickle-cell anemia (crises reduced by 70%).
Also helpful for dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and menses-related anemia
FDA required a black-box warning that Depo-Provera should not be used long-term
because it can cause bone loss. Studies have since shown this to be reversible bone
loss that does not increase fracture risk. Long term use in adolescents may affect peak
bone mineral density; calcium and Vitamin D supplements are recommended
Depo-SubQ 104 contains 104mg Medroxyprogesterone. It is given SC every 3 months.
Side-effects are similar to that of the IM formulation
Implanon: a single-rod implant contains 68 Etonogestrel and releases approximately
40mcg/day. Duration of protection is 3 years. Implanon is being replaced by Nexplanon
Nexplanon is radio-opaque implant. It contains the same amount of etonogestrel and is
bioequivalent to Implanon; it can also be used for up to 3 years, and is removed in the
same way
INTRAUTERINE DEVICE, HORMONAL (MIRENA)
Failure rate 0.7% cumulative for 5 years
Releases 20mcg Levonorgestrel per day
Insert during first 7 days of cycle, approved for 5 years of use
Mechanism: Thickens cervical mucus, sperm motility impairment, inhibition of ovulation,
inhibition of fertilization
Side-effects: Mastalgia, headache. No reported weight gain
May decrease incidence of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, PMS, endometrial hyperplasia
Rapid return to fertility: 79% pregnant by 12 months
Mirena is recommended for women who have had at least one child
Mirena has additional indication for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding for women
who choose to use IUD as their method of contraception
Skyla, a new lower dose version of Mirena, has been approved for the prevention of
pregnancy for up to 3 years. It contains 13.5mg Levonorgestrel and releases 14mcg/ day
after 24 days. This rate decreases progressively to 5mcg/day after 3 years
Liletta contains 52mg of Levonorgestrel and releases approximately 12–18mcg daily over
3 years
INTRAUTERINE DEVICE, NONHORMONAL (PARAGARD)
Failure rates 1–2%; spontaneous expulsion rate 5%
Copper Paragard T380A
Implant during menses, mid-cycle to prevent expulsion, or 12 weeks postpartum. Copper
T380A should be changed every 10 years
Especially useful in women who have completed child bearing and have only 1 sex
partner. Risk of PID and ectopic pregnancy are increased
Menstrual flow and cramping will most likely increase, may prescribe NSAIDs
prophylactically
COMBINATION HORMONAL PATCH (Ortho Evra)
Pregnancy rates equivalent to OCPs
20cm2 adhesive patch contains 6mg Norelgestromin and 0.75mg Ethinyl Estradiol
Patch placed on trunk or arm once a week—use for 3 weeks, then off for 1 week
Side-effects: adhesive dermatitis, headache, emotional lability, weight gain (1%)
The patch exposes women to a continuous level of estrogen higher than most oral
contraceptive pills. Studies found that users could have up to 2 times the risk of developing
venous thromboembolism (VTE) than those who take OCs
101
OB-GYN
Ortho Evra should not be used by patients who smoke and are over 35 years of age
HORMONAL VAGINAL CONTRACEPTIVE
Etonogestrel 120mcg per day/Ethinyl Estradiol 15mcg per day (NuvaRing)
One ring is inserted on or before day 5 of cycle and left in place for 3 weeks then
removed for 1 ring-free week
If switching from combination OCP, then insert within 7 days of last active pill
Vaginitis, leukorrhea, side-effects of estrogen and progesterone
MALE CONDOM
Theoretical and actual failure rates: 2% and 10%, respectively. Patients should be
instructed in use—the actual failure rate can fall dramatically with correct use
Better protection against STDs (including HIV if condoms with nonoxynol-9 are used)
Patients should be instructed not to use with oil-based lubricants, such as Vaseline
If used with a spermicidal vaginal foam, contraception failure rates approach OCs
FEMALE CONDOM
Failure rate 5–20%
Difficultto use
Protects against STDs
Can use any lubricant
DIAPHRAGM
Theoretical and actual failure rates: 2% and 20% when used with spermicide
Provides protection against pelvic infection and cervical dysplasia. Increased risk of UTIs
Must be inserted prior to intercourse but does not need to be removed and reinserted for
subsequent intercourse for next 12 hours (do need to use extra spermicide after 6 hours).
Cannot be left in longer than 12–18 hours (increased risk of UTIs)
Must wait 4–6 weeks postpartum to fit
PRENTIF CERVICAL CAP
Theoretical failure rate 9–20% in nulliparous women and 26–40% in women with prior
vaginal delivery
Thimble-shaped device, fitted to cervix with small amount of spermicide
Advantage: May be used for multiple episodes of intercourse, up to 48 hours, and requires
less contraceptive gel than diaphragm
Parous cervix may be difficult to fit
Pap smear needed prior to fitting, 3 months later, and annually thereafter
VAGINAL SPERMICIDES
Failure rates from 3–20% per year
Inserted before intercourse and may be used without replacement for repeated acts of
intercourse for 12–18 hours
Available OTC
2–4% of couples have allergic reactions
COITUS INTERRUPTUS
Failure rates 20–25% per year
FERTILITY BASED AWARENESS (Basal body temperature, calendar)
Failure rates from 2–20% depending on expertise of user
STERILIZATION
Male
Failure rate of only 0.1%
Couple needs to be sure that no more children are desired
102
OB-GYN
In office procedure with “scalpel-less” procedure
Easy to perform, local anesthesia
Female
Failure rates depend on procedure used—most effective postpartum
Failure rates increase over 10 years from 0.8% to 4%. Counsel the couple on their
certainty of sterilization. Can possibly be reversed, but at a cost of ~$10,000
Partial salpingectomy etc: Part of tube removed and ends tied. Can be open or
laparoscopic. Done in the OR with general or regional anesthesia
Essure: oil introduced into tubes transcervically with hysteroscope. Office based
procedure with local anesthesia
NO METHOD
Pregnancy rate of 85–90% per year
EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION
Administration of drugs to prevent pregnancy in women who have had recent
unprotected intercourse (including sexual assault), or to those who have had a failure of
another method of contraception (e.g., broken condom)
Mechanism of action: May act by inhibiting or delaying ovulation, interfering with
fertilization or tubal transport, preventing implantation by altering endometrial receptivity,
or possibly causing regression of the corpus luteum
Options
Copper IUD
Place within 120 hours of unprotected sex
Reduces risk of pregnancy up to 99%
Progestin-only pills (Levonorgestrel)
Plan B One-Step: One tablet (1.5mg Levonorgestrel) as soon as possible within 72
hours of unprotected sexual intercourse
Next Choice: One tablet (0.75mg Levonorgestrel) as soon as possible within 72
hours of unprotected sexual intercourse; a second 0.75mg tablet should be taken
12 hours after the first dose
Consider repeating the dose if vomiting occurs within 2 hours of Plan B One Step
and 1 hour of Next Choice. If severe vomiting occurs, may consider administering
the oral tablets vaginally (ACOG, 2010)
Plan B is available over the counter without age restriction (FDA News Release,
June 20, 2013). Next Choice is available without a prescription for ≥17 years of
age
Reduces risk of pregnancy up to 85%
Ulipristal (Ella): A progesterone agonist/antagonist
One tablet (30mg) taken as soon as possible within 120 hours (5 days) after
unprotected intercourse
Repeat the dose if vomited within 3 hours of taking Ulipristal
Common adverse reactions (≥5%): Headache, abdominal pain, nausea,
dysmenorrheal fatigue and dizziness
Available by prescription
Combination Estrogen/Progestin pills
Regimen of Ethinyl Estradiol (100mcg) and Levonorgestrel (0.5mg) taken twice,
12 hours apart. May use combinations of OCs such as 5 orange pills of Aviane or
LoSeasonique, 5 white pills of Lutera or Sronyx
Reduces risk of pregnancy 75–80%
Major side-effect of nausea and vomiting
Consider use of anti-emetic
CLINICAL PEARLS
Most cases of condom failure result from inappropriate usage. The number of condoms
that break is less than 2 per 100
103
OB-GYN
The number of women with chlamydia and gonorrhea who later develop infertility ranges
from 10–40%
Correct use of a male (or female) condom can drastically reduce the chance of contracting
a sexually transmitted disease
Nearly half of all pregnancies in U.S. are unintended
Implants and IUDs should be offered as first-line contraceptive options for sexually active
adolescents (ACOG guidelines 2012)
