33. EVALUATION OF BREAST MASS, BREAST PAIN
AND NIPPLE DISCHARGE
NIPPLE DISCHARGE: Third most common breast complaint. Most often benign
Differential
Intraductal papilloma
Ductal ectasia
Pituitary adenoma
Breast abscess/infection
Breast carcinoma
History
Duration of symptoms
Unilateral or bilateral. Color of discharge (clear, serous, milky, bloody, green).
Bilateral milky discharge suggests endocrine etiology; pathologic discharges are
usually unilateral and confined to 1 duct
Spontaneous or with stimulation (spontaneous discharge more common with
pathologic discharge)
Presence of blood (increases chances of malignancy)
Visual field defect (pituitary adenoma) or endocrine abnormalities (hypothalamic
hyperprolactinemia)
Medication use (oral contraceptives, psychotropics, antihypertensives, opiates)
Lactation/breastfeeding history
If mass is present, refer to section below
Physical exam: Asymmetry, breast mass, axillary/clavicular adenopathy, skin or nipple
changes (peau d’orange), express both nipples for discharge, hemoccult the discharge
Evaluation
If discharge is heme-negative and bilateral, then conservative management with
follow-up in 1–2 months. Obtain mammogram if not up to date. Evaluate for endocrine
abnormalities if indicated. If the discharge is still present in 1–2 months, then proceed
as if it were heme-positive
All patients with spontaneous or unilateral nipple discharge should receive
mammogram or ultrasound with potential referral for surgical evaluation regardless if
discharge is bloody or clear. If discharge is heme-positive, then consult a surgeon to
perform diagnostic mammography followed by possible terminal duct excision
Cytology is generally not useful—absence of malignant cells does not exclude cancer
Galactorrhea (milky discharge) evaluated differently than pathologic or clear
discharge. Review medications, TSH and prolactin levels. Galactorrhea may also be
secondary to chest wall trauma or nipple stimulation. Surgical referral generally not
necessary
BREAST PAIN (MASTALGIA): Has not been shown as risk for breast cancer
Differential
Fibrocystic breast disease
Strain on Cooper’s ligaments (large pendulous breast)
Malignancy
Costochondritis
Medications (oral contraceptives, psychotropics, and spironolactone)
128
OB-GYN
Trauma
Mastitis (See Chapter 4, Infant Formula & Breastfeeding)
History
Diffuse vs. focal
Cyclic vs. noncyclic pain
If mass present, refer to next section
Physical exam—Same as above
Evaluation
If mass is present, see Section III below
If < age 30 and no mass
Focal pain: Target ultrasound
Diffuse pain with no risk factors, no imaging needed. Have patient return for close
follow-up
If > age 30 and no mass, then proceed to breast imaging (mammography and target
ultrasound). If negative, have patient follow-up in 1–2 months for a recheck
Treatment
Supportive, well-fitted brassiere
NSAIDS (topical or oral)
Danazol: Approved by FDA for treatment of breast pain. 100–400mg/day. 75%
response rate, but high incidence of side-effects
Alternatives: Evening primrose oil, caffeine avoidance, Vitamin E may be helpful
BREAST MASS
History
Age of patient
Duration
Change in size
Fluctuation with menstrual cycle
Previous biopsies or masses
Personal history (i.e., reproductive history, radiation exposure, ETOH abuse, obesity)
Family history (relatives with breast cancer, ovarian cancer or mutation in genes
BRCA1/ BRCA2)
Physical exam
Cystic or solid
Regular or irregular borders
Movable or fixed
Enlarged lymph nodes
Skin changes; peau d’orange
Evaluation of solitary breast mass: Cystic or solid (determine by exam or ultrasound)
If cystic, then proceed to aspiration (22-gauge needle)
If aspiration non-bloody and mass disappears, follow-up in 4–6 weeks and
imaging per American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines—cytology not necessary
If aspiration is bloody or mass does not disappear, then breast imaging and referral
for biopsy
If solid, then breast imaging and referral for biopsy
TESTING
Mammography: USPSTF recommends assessing risks in patients aged 40–49 to
determine necessity for mammography, then biennial screening starting at age 50 to 74.
AAFP recommends assessing risks in patients 40–44, annual screening in patients 45–54,
and biennial screening in patients 55 and older. ACOG recommends shared decision
making with patient to consider starting mammograms at age 40, and start no later than age
50
Ultrasound: To evaluate breast masses in females under the age of 30 due to dense nature
of breast in young females
129
ID
MRI with gadolinium enhances most invasive breast CA. Though one study found it to
be almost 100% sensitive, all suspicious lesions need biopsied and therefore it is not cost
efficient. Does play a role for patients with silicone breast implants
Needle aspiration (98% sensitive, 97% specific) vs. core biopsy (large biopsy but
increased risk of bleeding and requires more anesthetic)
Excisional biopsy
INDICATIONS FOR BREAST BIOPSY
Equivocal cytological findings on aspiration
Bloody cyst fluid on aspiration
Failure of mass to disappear completely after fluid aspiration
Recurrence of cyst after 1 or 2 aspirations
Bloody nipple discharge
Nipple excoriation (Paget’s disease of breast)
Note: If abnormal core biopsy suggestive of inflammatory breast carcinoma, should be
followed up with full-thickness skin punch biopsy (preferably at least 2 samples)
CLINICAL PEARLS
Previously United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advised against
routine self-breast exams but in January 2016 USPSTF made a revision, stating they
support patients being aware of changes in their bodies and discussing these with their
clinicians.
Mammography is 75–90% sensitive at differentiating between benign and malignant
disease. Sensitivity is very dependent on interpreter’s skill
The differential diagnosis of a breast mass in a lactating woman includes blocked milk
ducts and mastitis. A blocked duct may be relieved by massaging the breast during nursing
along with warm compresses
