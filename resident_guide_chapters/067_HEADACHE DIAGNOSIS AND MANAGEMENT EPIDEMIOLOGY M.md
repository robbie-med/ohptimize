67. HEADACHE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most common pain problem seen in the ambulatory setting (greater than 10 million office
visits/year). Over 4 billion dollars are spent annually on over-the-counter medications for
headaches. This does not include time missed from work, prescription medications, or
physician visits
HISTORY: The cornerstone of diagnosis is to determine which headaches are more dangerous
(secondary to medical problems) by classifying as a primary (migraine, tension, cluster, etc.) or
secondary (CNS mass lesions, infections/meningitis, etc.) headache
Headache characteristics: Age of headache onset, location, frequency, severity, quality,
speed of onset, or triggers (foods, stress, hunger, menstrual cycle, cough/exertion, position
changes, etc.)
Associated symptoms: Photophobia, phonophobia, nausea/vomiting, sinus symptoms,
fever, stiff neck, focal neurologic complaints, visual changes
Medications: Past and present medications and response to treatment. Consider both
abortive and prophylactic therapies. OTC medications, caffeine use, and foods may be
triggers (MSG, red wine). Chronic analgesic use/abuse may lead to rebound headaches.
Medications which may cause headaches (nitrates, Reserpine, Indomethacin, Minoxidil,
Apresoline, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy)
Past medical and surgical history: Malignancy, stroke, head trauma, neurosurgery,
psychosocial history, hypertension, hematologic abnormalities, polymyalgia rheumatica
Family history: Migraines tend to be hereditary and begin in childhood or early adult life;
other headaches less so
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs: Fever (meningitis, sinusitis, viral syndromes), BP
Ophthalmologic: Pupils, funduscopic
HEENT: Tympanic membrane, nares and sinus exams, TMJ exam, temporal artery
swelling and tenderness (especially over age 50), scalp exam, neck exam (nuchal rigidity,
paraspinal tenderness or spasm, range of motion)
Neurologic: Visual fields, cranial nerves, motor, sensory, coordination, gait, and mental
status changes
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Primary headaches (benign)
Tension-type headache (related to physical, mental and/or emotional stress): 47%
Migraine headache (with or without aura): 31%
Cluster headache: 7%
Mixed headache (usually migraine/tension)
Rebound headache: Caffeine, Butalbital, and narcotics
Neuralgias (trigeminal, occipital) characterized by brief electrical/lancing pains
Uncommon syndromes (chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, cough/
exertional headache, coital headache)
Miscellaneous: TMJ dysfunction, chronic sinus/allergies
Secondary headaches (not so benign)
CNS mass lesions (tumor, abscess)
Vascular (cerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, stroke/
TIA, carotid dissection)
307
GEN
Infectious (meningitis, sinusitis, encephalitis)
Traumatic (epidural/subdural hematoma, subarachnoid/intracranial hemorrhage, post-
concussion syndrome)
Temporal arteritis: Greater than age 50, increased sedimentation rate, jaw claudication,
pain centered about one temple, visual symptoms
Pseudotumor cerebri: Headache with papilledema, visual loss and elevated CSF
pressure (typically occurs in young, overweight females), abrupt-onset HA with n/v,
exacerbated by coughing, straining, position changes
Miscellaneous: Post lumbar puncture, sleep apnea (morning headaches), carbon
monoxide poisoning, glaucoma, hypertensive
RED FLAGS SYMPTOMS: Worrisome features that indicate need for further work-up
First severe headache over 50 (concern for temporal arteritis, mass lesion, stroke)
Intense headache or “the worst headache of their life” without prior history of headache
Fever, nuchal rigidity, Kernig’s/Brudzinski’s sign (meningitis)
Papilledema
Diplopia
New/persistent neurologic signs
Elevated BP (diastolic > 110)
Unexplained vomiting
Exertional/cough headache (need MRI to rule out posterior fossa lesion)
Sudden change in headache pattern (Note: prior history of benign headache does not
rule out development of new cause for headache)
History of head trauma, malignancy or coagulopathy
TESTING: Consider testing as appropriate when any of the “red flags” above are present
Neuroimaging, including
Computed tomography (CT) scan: Best for detection of acute bleed (non-contrast)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Best for detection of posterior fossa disease, more
sensitive than CT for most conditions. More expensive
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): Aneurysm or other vascular lesion
Lumbar puncture: Evaluating meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased
intracranial pressure (assuming neuroimaging shows no mass lesion)
Electroencephalogram (EEG): Rarely helpful
Other diagnostic tests including CBC, sed. rate, thyroid panel, drug levels (Lithium).
Labs not generally helpful unless a specific diagnosis is suspected (e.g., hyperthyroidism,
pseudotumor cerebri (sed. rate), etc.)

MANAGEMENT

TREATMENT OF ACUTE MIGRAINE
NSAIDs: 1st line for mild to moderate migraine; effective for short-term relief
Combination analgesics
Combination analgesics containing Acetaminophen/caffeine/aspirin (Excedrin
migraine) are effective, inexpensive and available without prescription. Be aware of
rebound headache
Barbiturate-containing compounds (Butalbital/ASA/caffeine, Fioricet) have not
demonstrated effectiveness and can induce rebound headaches even at limited
quantities
Triptans: 1st line for moderate to severe headache or mild to moderate headache not
responsive to NSAIDs or combination analgesics
309
GEN
Triptans are effective in 65–70% of migraine attacks
Available in many forms: PO, rapidly-dissolving tablets, SC injection, IV, nasal sprays.
Oral triptan tablets are more effective if taken in the early phases of attack. If treatment
is delayed, injection or nasal spray may be more beneficial
Avoid in patient with cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled HTN,
hemiplegic migraine due to vasoconstrictive properties
Caution in those taking MAOIs or SSRIs due to serotonin syndrome as triptans work
by binding to serotonin receptor
All triptans have similar efficacy, tolerability, and cost
Triptans are different in their pharmacokinetic profile and route of administration.
Select a triptan that matches the needs of the individual patient. e.g., a slow onset of
action and longer-lasting triptan may be appropriate for slow-onset, longer-lasting
migraine attacks
Non-responders of one triptan may respond to another of the class
Anti-emetics: Evidence supports role of IV, but not PO preparations in emergency setting.
Reglan, Ondansetron (Zofran), Compazine and Phenergan also available
Dexamethasone: Used as adjunctive therapy only in emergency setting
Ergot alkaloids: Bind to serotonin receptor. 2nd line after triptans
Ergotamine has long half-life and duration of action (up to 3 days). Avoid frequent use
due to rebound headache
Dihydroergotamine is available in IV, IM, SC, (DHE-45) and nasal spray (Migranal)
Use limited by poor absorption and adverse SEs (n/v, peripheral and central vaso-
constriction)
Avoid in patients with cardiovascular history
MIGRAINE PROPHYLAXIS
When to consider prophylaxis
≥2 migraines/month with disability lasting ≥3 days/month
Failure of, contraindication to, or adverse events from acute treatments
Use of abortive medication ≥2 × per week
Uncommon migraine conditions (e.g., hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine, mi-
graine with aura, migraine-inducing infarction)
When to stop therapy: After successful therapy (migraine frequency reduction by ≥50%)
has been maintained for 6–12 months

CLINICAL PEARLS
Myofascial pain, difficulty in concentration, emotional lability, divorce and job loss
frequently accompany post-traumatic headache
Headaches typically worse in the morning are: Pseudotumor cerebri, sleep apnea, and
carbon monoxide poisoning
Frequent use of Ergotamine, caffeine/Butalbital containing products, NSAIDs, and
Excedrin can cause rebound headaches
Migraines are frequently misdiagnosed as sinus headaches (many migraines hurt over sinus
region, have congestion and are triggered by weather changes)
Use abortive therapies as early as possible
Avoid opiates and barbiturates in migraine abortive therapy due to potential for abuse and
rebound headache, use only in recalcitrant migraines
