1. THE NEWBORN EXAM
HISTORY
Review perinatal, pregnancy, and family histories, feeding, stooling, voiding, and Apgar scores
at birth
PHYSICAL EXAM
Initial Assessment (APGAR scoring): performed at 1, 5, and sometimes 10 minutes after
birth. Useful as quick assessment of newborn immediately after delivery

This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
General: Neonate should be completely undressed prior to the exam. Observe for normal
muscle tone (flexion of upper and lower extremities), movement of all extremities, and
respiratory pattern
Evaluate gestational age using Ballard scoring
Determine average (AGA), large (LGA, > 90th percentile) or small (SGA, < 10th
percentile) for gestational age by plotting weight, length and head circumference on a
normogram
Respiratory
Color: Central and peripheral, peripheral cyanosis is normal
Breathing: Normal respiratory rate is 40–60/minute; grunting and nasal flaring are
not normal—if detected, further work-up is necessary. Consider transient tachypnea,
pneumothorax, sepsis or congenital cardiac disease
Auscultation: Perform prior to any manipulation of the infant (holding the infant or
providing a gloved finger to suck on may quiet a crying infant). Listen for equal and
bilateral breath sounds
Cardiovascular
Normal rate is 120–160 BPM
An irregularly irregular heart rate, caused by premature atrial contractions, is common
and benign in the first few days of life
Murmurs
This may be an important finding on the newborn exam; consider other factors
including color, perfusion, blood pressure, ability to feed
Many benign murmurs resolve in first 24–48 hours
If further work-up is warranted, start with a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood pressure
in all 4 extremities
Pulses: Palpate femoral pulses (if absent, may indicate coarctation of the aorta)
Infants with major cardiac anomalies may not have a murmur in the initial newborn

period with a closing ductus arteriosus, thus screen all infants for congenital heart
disease prior to discharge from the nursery. This is accomplished by obtaining an
oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry in the right upper and lower extremity. Any infant
with a positive screen (< 90% in either, < 95% in both the hand and foot or > 3%
difference between the hand and foot) should have a diagnostic echocardiogram. See
algorithm for details
Gastrointestinal: Because of relatively weak abdominal musculature, palpation of internal
organs is possible
The liver should be palpable and often extends below the costal margin
The spleen usually is not palpable
Palpate for renal/abdominal masses (Wilms’ tumor, neuroblastoma)
Umbilical cord should be inspected and contain two arteries and one vein, as well as
for umbilical hernia
Genitourinary
Males
Palpate testicles (testicles may need to be guided down from above scrotum into
scrotum). Hydroceles are common and will usually resolve within the first 6
months. Hydrocele with trans-illuminate, whereas hernia would not
Check the penis for hypospadias or epispadias—if present, consult a urologist and
do not circumcise the infant
Females
The labia majora may temporarily enlarge due to presence of maternal hormones
Spread the labia, and observe for vaginal wall cysts or imperforate hymen
A white discharge may be seen as well as pseudomenses (from presence of
maternal hormones)
Rectal inspection: Check for position and patency (monitor for bowel movement).
A fistula can be mistaken for a normal anus; however, position of a fistula is usually
anterior or posterior to the location of a normal anus
Gluteal cleft abnormalities
Examine in the midline over spine for presence of a dimple, hypertrichosis,
capillary hemangioma, atretic meningocele or subcutaneous mass
Sacral dimples plus other finds as above and/or neurologic findings warrants MRI
Sacral dimples > 5mm in diameter or > 2.5cm above anus requires ultrasound or
MRI
Extremities
Hip clicks: The following maneuvers screen for congenital dysplasia of the hip
Barlow test: Adduction and posterior pressure may produce a “clunk” of
subluxation or dislocation of femur
Ortolani test: Abduct and lift femur back into place
Assess for club feet (plantar flexion of foot, inversion deformity of heel, and forefoot
varus), polydactyly or syndactyly, and forefoot adduction
Examine for crepitus or discoloration over the clavicles and decreased movement of
affected arm (most commonly fractured bones in infants)

Examine the skull for caput succedaneum (tissue swelling that crosses suture
lines—no therapy needed), or cephalohematomas (well-demarcated swelling that
does not cross suture lines, which may be associated with skull fracture)
Mobility of the suture lines (craniosynostosis): One or more suture lines are not
mobile
Fontanelles: If head circumference is normal (33–37cm) and suture lines are
mobile, size of fontanelles are not important; anterior fontanelle should be
palpated, but the posterior fontanelle may not be palpable
Eyes: Examine for bilateral red reflex with ophthalmoscope at a distance of 1–2 feet. If
there is difficulty opening neonate’s eyes, try sitting infant up or holding upside down
and rapidly bringing to an upright position (infant gets disoriented and instinctively
opens eyes). Subconjunctival hemorrhages are common after vaginal delivery
Ears: Assess size, shape, and position, appreciate any pits or tags. All newborns should
have hearing assessed using auditory brainstem response or optoacoustic emissions
test
Mouth: Palpate and visualize for cleft palate. Small white cysts (Epstein’s pearls)
may be noted on the hard palate and are a normal finding. Natal teeth usually require
removal and may be associated with congenital anomalies. Assess for ankyloglossia,
or short frenulum which may interfere with breastfeeding
Neurologic: Most of the neurologic exam is done while performing the rest of the
neonatal physical exam. Important aspects of the neurologic exam include observation of
movement, evaluating body tone when handled, and observing appropriate crying during
the exam. Check for facial nerve paralysis due to trauma during delivery
Moro (startle) reflex: Grasp the neonate’s hands and carefully pull the baby up—as
you bring the head back down toward the crib, let go and the Moro reflex should occur.
(Abduction of arms and legs, extension of elbow and knees followed by flexion)
Sucking and rooting reflex
Rooting occurs when the baby’s lips are stroked laterally and the head turns
toward the ipsilateral side
Assess the suck reflex by placing a finger in the infant’s mouth
Stepping reflex: Hold the infant upright and lean him/her forward. This should cause
the baby to instinctively produce a stepping action (this reflex does not always occur)
Head control: Assess head lag while holding the infant’s hands and pulling him/her
upright. Head should lag, come to the midline briefly, then fall forward
Skin: Common normal findings include
Milia: Small white cysts on the baby’s nose, cheeks, or forehead
Nevi or Mongolian spots: Brown/blue patches on the torso that typically disappear
within months
Macular hemangiomas: “Angel kiss” or “stork bites” on the face or neck
Erythema toxicum neonatorum: Fleeting erythematous papules and pustules
Sucking blister: On upper or lower lip
Dry skin: With cracking and peeling in post-dates infants
Miliaria: Blocked sweat glands ducts appear as papules and/or pustules
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS
Hepatitis B vaccine: (See Chapter 3, Childhood Immunization Schedule)
Follow-up 3–5 days for routine exam (sooner if poor weight gain, hyperbilirubinemia. See
Chapter 5)
Discuss with the parents signs/symptoms of neonatal sepsis (lethargy, poor feeding
habits, crying and inconsolable, rectal temperature > 100.4º F). Instruct parents to contact
family physician if these problems arise
