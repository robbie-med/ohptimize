68. EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIZZINESS
INTRODUCTION
About 5% of outpatient visits are for dizziness
The 4 main categories are
Vertigo
Presyncope/syncope
Imbalance and ataxia (disequilibrium)
Psychogenic
The history and physical exam are the cornerstone of diagnosis
Medications are frequent causes of dizziness
HISTORY
Define the type of dizziness: Vertigo vs. lightheadedness vs. imbalance/ataxia
Provoking factors: Positional changes, changes in head positions
Acuity of onset
Aural symptoms: Hearing loss, tinnitus
Focal neurologic symptoms
Visual symptoms: Diplopia, decreased acuity
Cardiac symptoms: Palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath
Infectious symptoms
Past medical history: Diabetes, alcohol, syphilis, migraine headaches, cardiac disease
Medications
Trauma
Recent travel history (cruises and long plane flights can induce dizziness)
PHYSICAL EXAM
Neuro exam: Cranial nerves, finger to nose, dysdiadochokinesia and Romberg—distin-
guish central from peripheral lesions
Eye: Visual acuity, extra-ocular muscles, fundi and discs
Ear: Tympanic membrane, external ear. Hearing test
Neck: Nuchal rigidity or pain with movement. Reproduction of symptoms with movement.
Carotid bruits
Cardiac: Murmurs, signs of ischemia
Gait
Hallpike maneuver: Patient sits on bed while clinician supports head. Patient rapidly
assumes supine position first with head straight, then turned 45° left then 45° right. With
reproduction of symptoms, vertigo and nystagmus, benign positional vertigo is suggested.
Also, vertigo duration less than 1 minute, latency 2–20 seconds, unidirectional nystagmus,
fatigability. Note: This test is neither sensitive nor specific and should be used in context of
complete evaluation to make a diagnosis
OTHER TESTS—AS INDICATED BY HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
Brain MRI or CT: MRI is much more sensitive than CT for dizziness since the region of
the brain to be evaluated is usually the posterior fossa. Usually performed with contrast to
help pick up acoustic neuromas
Audiography: Low frequency loss in Meniere’s disease
Electronystagmography (ENG): Most helpful in Meniere’s disease and benign positional
vertigo. Helpful in cases with medicolegal implications and psychogenic vertigo
Lumbar puncture: Helpful when suspect multiple sclerosis, meningitis, or subarachnoid
bleed

GEN
Cardiac evaluation if presyncope: Consider EKG, ECHO, EPS depending on symptoms
EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF VERTIGINOUS DIZZINESS
Condition
Vertiginous
symptoms
Nystagmus
Comments
Associated
symptoms
Management
Benign positional
vertigo
Vertigo: Positional,
provoked by
certain head
positions.
Positional with
latency, brief
duration and
fatigability.
Horizontal.
Usually idiopathic,
may result from
head trauma,
ear surgery,
or sequelae
of vestibular
neuronitis.
None.
Positioning
maneuvers to
rid the posterior
semicircular canal
of debris.
Meniere’s disease
Vertigo: Often
with nausea and
vomiting that lasts
hours (not days or
weeks).
Spontaneous
during critical
stage, postural in
25% of patients
during first few
weeks after an
attack. Caloric
testing reveals loss
or impairment of
thermally induced
nystagmus on
involved side.
Triad: Vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing
loss. Both ears
affected in 30–50%
of patients.
1. Tinnitus (louder
during attacks).
2. Sensorineural
hearing loss (low
frequency).
3. Fullness in ear
during attack.
Goal: To lower
endolymphatic
pressure.
1. Low salt diet
(< 2g Na+/day).
2. Diuretics
(HCTZ 50–100mg/
day).
3. Surgical
decompression.
Vestibular
neuronitis
Vertigo
accompanied
by nausea and
vomiting lasting
days to weeks.
Acute onset.
Increases when
gaze is directed
away from
affected ear and is
suppressed with
visual fixation.
Auditory function
not affected. BPV
may develop as
sequelae.
Antecedent or
concomitant acute
viral illness.
Does not recur
Symptomatic.
Labyrinthitis
Acute onset
of vertigo and
hearing loss
which lasts 3–5
days. Rapid head
movements may
bring on vertigo.
Same as vestibular
neuronitis.
Hearing loss
may be total and
permanent. Need
to differentiate
viral (serous)
from bacterial
(suppurative)
labyrinthitis.
Antecedent or
concomitant acute
viral illness.
Does not recur.
Tapered oral
prednisone
may be helpful.
Suppurative
labyrinthitis must
be treated with
antibiotics.
Acoustic
schwannoma
(acoustic
neuroma)
Vertigo: Usually
late, more often a
progressive feeling
of imbalance.
Occasionally
provoked by
sudden head
movements.
Spontaneous type
frequently present.
Asymmetric
sensorineural
hearing loss.
Usually
unsteadiness and
imbalance. Vertigo
occurs in < 20% of
cases. Tinnitus is
common.
Diagnosed with
MRI scanning.
1. Facial weakness.
2. Diplopia.
3. Headache.
4. Elevated CSF
protein.
5. Hyperesthesia
or hypoesthesia
in distribution
of eighth or fifth
cranial nerve.
Surgery.
CNS
vertigo
Vertigo: Nearly
always positional
—provoked by
certain head
positions.
Usually
accompanies the
vertigo.
1. Usually in the
elderly.
2. Symptoms
associated with
arteriosclerosis,
brainstem ischemia
(visual symptoms),
or cervical
arthritis.
Directed to specific
etiology.

SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF TRUE VERTIGO
Acute vertigo: First few days
Vestibular suppressants
Meclizine: 12.5–25mg PO every 6 hours PRN
314
GEN
Valium: 2–5mg PO every 6 hours PRN
Antiemetics: Compazine, Phenergan, Ondansetron (Zofran)
Hospitalize if dehydrated or for other medical reasons
Subacute vertigo
Stop vestibular suppressants
Vestibular exercises
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): Perform Epley maneuver. Maneuver
is 80+% effective for this condition and has been demonstrated effective in the primary
care setting. Don’t use with known severe cervical spine disease or high grade carotid/
vertebrobasilar disease
Step A: Perform the Dix-Hallpike test with the patient’s head rotated 45° toward the
affected (right) ear, the neck slightly extended, and the chin pointed slightly upward
Step B: When the vertigo and nystagmus provoked by the Dix-Hallpike test stop,
rotate the patient’s head about the rostral-caudal body axis until the unaffected ear is
downward
Step C: Further rotate the head and body until the patient is face down, and maintain
this position for 10 to 15 seconds
Step D: Keeping the head facing toward the shoulder on the unaffected side, bring
the patient to a seated position and keep the head tilted so that the chin points slightly
downward
Have patient sleep at 45–90° angle for next 1–2 nights
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients with BPPV (especially those who respond favorably to maneuvers) do not gener-
ally need further testing. BPPV recurs about 30% of the time over the next 30 months
Gait disturbance can be seen in central and peripheral vertigo
In patients with multiple sclerosis, vertigo is the initial complaint in 5% and ultimately
occurs in 50% of patients
Symptoms of Meniere’s disease may be mimicked in secondary and tertiary syphilis.
Consider screening all patients with Meniere’s disease with VDRL or RPR
The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of acoustic neuroma is 4 years with
an incidence of 1 case in 100,000 persons
