60. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Note: This Chapter is for management of patients with known coronary artery disease. For
diagnosis of patients with chest pain or evaluation with stress testing, See Chapters 48, 57
ETIOLOGY: Clinical manifestations are usually caused by fissuring, hemorrhage, and
thrombosis of plaque in epicardial coronary arteries (plaque rupture). Plaque is comprised of
subintimal collections of abnormal fat, cells, and debris
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
When ischemic cardiac events are transient, the patient may experience angina pectoris;
if prolonged, can lead to myocardial necrosis and scarring with or without the clinical
picture of MI
Patients can also present with cardiomegaly and heart failure secondary to ischemic
damage of left ventricle
HISTORY
Description of pain: Character (tightness, squeezing, pressure), location, radiation (neck,
shoulder(s), arm(s), jaw), onset, duration, exacerbating and relieving factors. May be more
important to ask about chest discomfort rather than pain. Ask about chest pain/discomfort
with exertion
Associated symptoms: Dyspnea, diaphoresis, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, nausea
with or without vomiting, peripheral edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Negative symptoms include pain associated with motion or deep breathing and positional
pain, pain on palpation, or sharp pain
Note: Pericarditis is worse when supine and relieved when sitting forward
Cardiac risk factors
Absolute: Family history, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (LDL >
130, HDL < 35), Age (male > 45, female > 55)
Relative: Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, stress, postmenopausal state
Other: History of cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular disease
History of heart disease: CAD/MI, arrhythmia, valvular disease, previous heart
catheterization or stress test, PTCA or CABG. Obtain old EKGs
5 questions recommended to be asked during follow-up of patients with angina
Have you decreased your physical activity since the last visit?
Have your anginal symptoms increased?
How are you tolerating therapy?
How successful have you been at reducing risk factors?
Have you developed any comorbid illness which may worsen your angina?
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs: Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation
HEENT: Hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy, JVD, carotid bruit, thyromegaly
Lungs: Rales, pleural effusions
Cardiovascular: Arrhythmia, murmur, rub, gallop, click, abnormal apical impulse
Abdomen: Hepatomegaly (CHF/hepatojugular reflux)
Extremities: Cyanosis, clubbing, edema, shiny hairless legs (PVD)
Skin: Xanthomas, diabetic skin changes
EVALUATION
Laboratory
258
GEN
Lipid profiles: See Chapter 58, Hyperlipidemia
Cardiac enzymes: For patients whose ambulatory presentation suggests acute MI
(concerning symptoms lasting longer than 15–20 minutes), cardiac enzymes should be
ordered in an acute care setting. Troponin level peaks in 2–4 hours and falls in 10–14
days. CPK peaks at 6–8 hours and then falls within 24 hours
Other: Thyroid panel
Chest XR: The presence of cardiomegaly, LV aneurysm, or pulmonary edema is
associated with poorer long-term prognosis
EKG
Normal EKG does not exclude the diagnosis of CAD; 12-lead EKG recorded at rest is
normal in approximately half of patients with angina pectoris
With angina ST segments are usually depressed, but may be elevated in early stages of
acute MI and in Prinzmetal’s angina
T-wave and ST segment changes are nonspecific and may occur in pericardial,
valvular, and myocardial disease, or with anxiety, changes in posture, medications, or
esophageal disease
Echocardiography: To assess LV function in patients with history of MI, pathological Q
waves, signs or symptoms of heart failure, systolic murmur suggesting mitral regurgitation,
or patient with complex ventricular arrhythmias
Cardiac stress testing (radionuclide or echocardiography): See Chapter 48, Cardiac
Stress Testing. Indications for patients with diagnosis of myocardial ischemia
Patient with significant change in cardiac symptoms to identify extent, severity, and
location of ischemia
EKG abnormalities including WPW, paced rhythm, > 1mm resting ST depression,
LBBB
After cardiac catheterization to identify if ischemia is present in the distribution of the
coronary lesion identified
Coronary angiography: Indications for patients with diagnosis of myocardial ischemia
Patients with a significant change in symptoms or with severe angina despite medical
therapy
Patients with high risk criteria on noninvasive testing regardless of angina severity
Clinical characteristics which indicate high likelihood of severe CAD or high
probability of left main or triple vessel disease
Non-diagnostic noninvasive testing
Patients who have survived sudden cardiac death or serious ventricular arrhythmia
Patients with angina and heart failure
Patients suspected of having a non-atherosclerotic cause of myocardial ischemia
(coronary artery anomaly, Kawasaki disease, primary coronary artery dissection,
radiation induced vasculopathy)
Suspected coronary artery vasospasm
MANAGEMENT
Correction of reversible risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, stress). See related Chapters for
diagnosis and management
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Minimize medications which may exacerbate angina, including sympathomimetics
259
GEN
Treat associated conditions which may exacerbate angina, including hypoxemia, anemia,
diabetes, valvular heart disease
Exercise training program (may result in reduction of ischemia, improvement in lipids
and blood glucose, and decrease in obesity) and weight reduction in obese patients
Anti-platelet medications
Aspirin: 75–325mg PO daily. Associated with 33% decrease in risk of adverse cardiac
events
Clopidogrel (Plavix): 75mg PO daily. Should be used in those who failed ASA, cannot
tolerate ASA, or are allergic to ASA
Ticagrelor (Brilinta): 90mg BID. Indicated for treatment of ACS with aspirin
Prasugrel (Effient): 10mg daily. With aspirin, for treatment of ACS in patients treated
with PCI
ß-Blockers
Metoprolol (Lopressor): Start dose at 50mg BID, titrate to a target dose of 100mg BID
Atenolol (Tenormin): 50mg PO BID or 100mg PO daily
Timolol (Blocadren): 10mg PO BID
Carvedilol (Coreg): Start dose at 6.25mg BID, titrate to a target dose of 25mg BID
Propranolol (Inderal): 60–80mg PO TID
Avoid ß-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity like Acebutolol, Pindolol,
Labetalol
Calcium channel blockers: Decrease coronary resistance and increase coronary blood
flow. Use in patients with contraindications or unacceptable side-effects of ß-blockers or in
combination with ß-blockers when initial therapy with ß-blockers is not effective
Note: Do not use short-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists as they may increase
cardiac events
Amlodipine (Norvasc): 5mg PO daily initially, may increase to 10mg daily
Nicardipine (Cardene): 20mg PO TID initially, may increase to 120mg in 3 divided
doses
Nifedipine (Adalat CC): 30mg PO daily, maximum 90mg daily; (Procardia XL)
30–60mg PO daily, maximum 90mg daily
Diltiazem (Cardizem SR): 60–120mg BID; (Cardizem CD) 120–300mg daily; (Dilacor
XR) 180–240mg PO daily initially, maximum 480mg daily
Verapamil (Calan SR): 180mg PO every morning initially, maximum 480mg daily,
elderly or small patients immediate-release 40mg TID; (Isoptin SR) 120–180mg PO
every morning initially, maximum 240mg every 12 hours
Note: Nifedipine is the most likely to cause reflex tachycardia
Nitrates: Have been shown to improve exercise tolerance, time to onset of angina and
work well in combination with ß-blockers and calcium channel antagonists. Nitrates do not
decrease mortality
Short-acting: Nitroglycerin spray (0.4mg) or SL NTG 1/150 grain (0.4mg), 1/100 grain
(0.6mg), or 1/200 grain (0.3mg)—1 SL every 5 minutes × 3 PRN angina. Should be
taken 5 minutes before any activity likely to precipitate angina. If pain persists after
3 doses, patient should be evaluated in ER to rule out MI. Patients who require more
doses of nitrates or who are not responding as well as they had previously should be
re-evaluated
Long-acting
Transdermal NTG: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6mg/hour—should be removed for 8 hours per
day
Isosorbide Dinitrate (Isordil): 20–80mg PO TID
Isosorbide Mononitrate
Imdur: (Extended release): Initiate at 30mg every morning and titrate dose to
120mg every morning
Ismo (Immediate release): 20mg BID, with the 2 doses given 7 hours apart
NTG deteriorates with exposure to air, moisture, and sunlight. If sublingual
administration does not cause a slight burning/tingling, NTG may be inactive
Ranolazine (Ranexa)
260
GEN
Indicated for treatment of chronic angina
Dosage: Start at 500mg BID. Increase to 1000mg BID as PRN
Common side-effects: Dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea
Can prolong QT interval in a dose-related manner
Increase BP (approx. 15mmHg) in patients with severe renal impairment. Monitor
renal function in patient with CrCl < 60mL/minute
Drug interactions
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., Diltiazem, Verapamil, Erythromycin): Limit Ranexa to
500mg BID
CYP3A substrates: Reduce dose of these drugs (e.g., Lovastatin, Cyclosporine,
Tacrolimus, Sirolimus). Limit Simvastatin to 20mg daily
CYP2D6 substrates (e.g., TCAs, antidepressants, antipsychotics): Reduce dose of
these drugs
Digoxin: Reduce dosage
Metformin: Limit to 1700mg daily
Combination therapy: Medications may be additive in effect. Exercise caution in giving
a ß-blocker and negative chronotropic calcium channel blocker as this has a greater
chance of leading to heart block. Particularly potent combination may be a ß-blocker and a
calcium channel blocker with a small amount of negative chronotropic effect
Follow-up every 4–12 months
MEDICAL THERAPY VS. REVASCULARIZATION
With stable angina, medical therapy is comparable to angioplasty. Medical therapy
reduces the risk on MI and angioplasty results in more rapid relief of symptoms. Patients
with left main stenosis > 70% and multivessel CAD with proximal LAD stenosis > 70%
have better survival with CABG
Indications for revascularization procedures (PTCA, STENT, CABG)
Failed medical therapy (intolerable symptoms despite maximal medical therapy)
Left main coronary artery stenosis > 50% (with or without symptoms)
Triple vessel disease and LV dysfunction (EF < 50% or previous MI)
2 vessel disease with significant proximal LAD CAD and either EF < 50% or ischemia
on noninvasive testing
Unstable angina symptomatic on stress testing despite maximal medical therapy
Post-MI patient continuing to have angina or ischemia
Relative indications include patients with anatomically critical lesions (> 90%),
especially in the LAD, or physiologic evidence of severe ischemia by stress testing or
ambulatory monitoring
PTCA vs. CABG: Two main comparative trials are the Bypass Angioplasty
Revascularization Investigation (BARI) and the Emory Angioplasty versus Surgery Trial
(EAST). They showed similar 5-year survival in all patients except diabetics who had a
survival advantage with CABG (with multiple severe lesions)
CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients who are low risk and do not have indications for CABG have a 1% annual mortality
Most patients who die suddenly from ischemic heart disease do so as a result of ischemia-
induced malignant ventricular tachycardia
In variant (Prinzmetal’s) angina, the chest discomfort characteristically occurs at rest or
awakens the patient from sleep. Condition is caused by focal spasm of proximal coronary
arteries
PTCA is more effective than medical therapy for the relief of angina in patients with
single-vessel coronary artery disease
Cholesterol (HDL, LDL and cholesterol) are falsely lowered and TG increased after an
acute MI
