7. ASTHMA IN CHILDREN
DEFINITION: Chronic inflammatory disease causing airway hyper-responsiveness, airflow
limitation and variable respiratory symptoms which are usually reversible, either spontaneously
or with therapy
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND EFFECTS OF ASTHMA ON CHILDREN
Approximately 7.5% of children currently have asthma, i.e., 5.5 million of the children
in the U.S. (2019 CDC statistics)
The prevalence of asthma attacks in children with known asthma is greater than 50%
over a 12 month period, i.e., 2.7 million of the children in the U.S.
More severe disability and more frequent hospitalizations in black children than in white
children; Higher mortality rate in black children than white children
50% of children with asthma miss school because of the disease
Uncontrolled childhood asthma may cause permanent damage to a child’s respiratory
system
HISTORY
Symptoms: Episodic or chronic cough, shortness of breath, heavy breathing, wheeze
or cough with exertion, cold air, viral infection, or exposure to allergens. Symptoms are
often worse during the evening or early morning hours. Typically there is more than one
respiratory symptom (2020 GINA Guidelines)
Other: Allergies, family history of asthma or allergy, perinatal exposure to tobacco smoke,
viral URI history, low birth weight
PHYSICAL EXAM: Often normal physical exam. May have enlarged turbinates, rhinitis,
nasal polyps, wheezing, increased respiratory effort, use of accessory muscles, eczema/atopic
dermatitis. Note: Children with a clear lung exam in the office can still be symptomatic at night
or with exertion
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Obstruction of large airways: Foreign body, congenital
Obstruction of large and small airways: Infection (bronchiolitis and chlamydia), cystic
fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia
EVALUATION (Individualized)
CXR: May show hyperinflation
Pulmonary function tests: Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry. Post-bronchodilator
assessment should be done 15–20 minutes after inhalation of a short-acting bronchodilator.
Patients with asthma have a variable airflow obstruction (20% or more) with serial
spirometry or peak-flow measurements, and an increase in forced expiratory volume in 1
second (FEV1) of 12% or more after bronchodilator therapy
Peak expiratory flow meter: Increase patient and caregiver awareness of disease status.
Highest of 3 peak flow measurements is recorded (patient must exhale as hard and fast as
possible). Measurements can be compared to norms for height and weight, and compared
to patient’s baseline when asymptomatic

MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC ASTHMA
TABLE 1: STEPWISE APPROACH
ADJUVANT THERAPY
Education about expectations, symptom assessment, and avoiding exposures is essential.
Daily self-management plans and emergency action plans can be obtained from the
National Asthma Education and Prevention Program of the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute ( www.nhlbisupport.com )
Avoidance of allergens and triggers: Consider aspirin and NSAIDs, tobacco smoke,
remove pets from house (or at least from bedroom), limit outdoor activities when pollen
counts are high or if air is cold, dust mite precautions (encasing mattresses, removing
carpet and stuffed animals, washing all bedding every 1 to 2 weeks in hot water). Some
irritants include fireplace smoke, perfumes, cleaning agents. Stress and GERD can also
contribute
Ask about nocturnal symptoms and number of inhalers used per year. Children should
not use more than 2 or 3 Albuterol inhalers per year—if so, the patient needs better chronic
control of the disease. Spacers make MDIs easier to use and are essential in children < 5
years; dry powder inhalers are appropriate for children if they can master the technique
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE EPISODES
Assessment of signs and symptoms, home PEFR, office PEFR, office pulse oximetry
To determine need for hospitalization: Respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, color,
lung exam (inaudible breath sounds are sign of severe exacerbation), speech pattern,
alertness
Medication: See chart below for usual medications used in acute asthma exacerbations
Stepwise Approach for Management of Asthma in Individuals Ages 0‒4 years;
Stepwise Approach for Management of Asthma in Individuals Ages 5‒11 years;
Stepwise Approach for Management of Asthma in Individuals Ages 12 years &
Older.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Long-term data show that children who use inhaled steroids over a period of years grow to
their expected height, comparable with peers and family
Goals of treatment: Child should sleep though the night, should have no restrictions on
activity or attendance at school, normal PFTs, few to no side-effects from medications
Consider use of SMART (“Single Maintenance and Reliever Therapy," a combined ICS-
LABA used as both maintenance and as-needed symptom relief), which may reduce the
risk of asthma exacerbations (strongest evidence for patients 12 years-old or greater)
