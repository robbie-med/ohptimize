14. CONSTIPATION IN CHILDREN
INTRODUCTION
Definition: Delay or difficulty in defecation present for > 2 weeks which causes distress to
patient
Normal number of stools in infants is widely variable 5/week to 40/week (3/day–1/week
in breast-fed and 2/day in formula fed) and in children > 3 years is 3–14/week
Approximately 3% of pediatric visits are related to defecation disorder complaints
In children, the most common cause is functional constipation. Children commonly
withhold feces by contracting the anal sphincter and buttocks. Over time, this behavior can
lead to involuntary contraction of these muscles in response to stool, as well as stretching
of the bowel allowing it to retain larger caliber stool
HISTORY
Determine what the family means by constipation (frequency, consistency, size, painful
BM), duration of symptoms, toilet training, encopresis, fecal soiling
Time after birth of first BM
Blood on toilet paper or in stool
Abdominal pain
Fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss (or poor weight gain)
Medications (current medications plus any medications used for constipation in the past)
Psychosocial (family dynamics, use of school bathrooms)
Other: Coarse hair, dry skin, or other symptoms of thyroid disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac
disease
Family history of Hirschsprung disease, constipation
Alarm signs/symptoms: Fever, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, failure to thrive, anal stenosis,
tight empty rectum, impaction or distention, delayed passage of meconium
PHYSICAL EXAM
General: appearance of infant/child, growth parameters
Abdomen: Distention, mass, hepatosplenomegaly
GU
External exam of perineum and perianal area for perianal wink, sensation, fissures,
dermatitis, abscess, fistula
If indicated, perform digital rectal exam for anal tone, blood in stool, rectal size, fecal
impaction
Back/spine: Dimple, tuft of hair
Neuro: Tone, strength, cremasteric reflex, DTRs
EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS < 6 MONTHS OF AGE
Those with a normal H&P and no red flags may be managed for functional constipation
with dietary modification or medications. If any red flags are present, then obtain
consultation with pediatric gastroenterologist
The complaint of constipation is common in infants, especially in breastfed infants.
Breastfed infants may only stool once a week, and if stool is soft and in the absence of red
flags, reassurance given
If formula fed, verify formula preparation, consider changing formula, and if treatment is
necessary consider:

PEDS
Lactulose: 1–3mL/kg/day in divided doses BID
Glycerin suppository: One pediatric suppository, given once only. Avoid enemas
EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS > 6 MONTHS OF AGE
General
Treatment options for disimpaction
Oral medications: Mineral oil, polyethylene glycol electrolyte solutions
Rectal disimpaction: Phosphate soda, saline, or mineral oil enemas
Suppository: Glycerin (for infants) bisacodyl (for children > age 3)
Oral maintenance medication. Polyethylene glycol is most effective. Other options
include mineral oil, magnesium hydroxide, lactulose, sorbitol or combination of two.
Wean after having regular BMs for several months
Dietary modification (increase fluids, fiber, balanced diet)
Parental education and behavioral modification including regular toileting and stool
diary for older children
Two separate algorithms were created with the age cut off of 6 months, because children
above or below this age marker have different diagnostic considerations (congenital, feeding,
and developmental factors)

HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
Lack of ganglion cells in the distal colon which results in sustained contraction and
dilation of the bowel proximal to aganglionic segment (due to distal obstruction)
Occurs in 1/5,000 births, often associated with trisomy 21
Mean age of diagnosis is 2½ months, but 8–20% are diagnosed after age 3
Symptoms may include bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and refusal to feed
Approximately 90% of normal infants pass meconium in the first 24 hours of life,
compared to less than 10% of patients with Hirschsprung disease
May present later in childhood with “short segment” Hirschsprung disease
Enterocolitis is the most serious complication, with a mortality of 20% and symptoms
including sudden onset of fever, abdominal distension, and bloody diarrhea
Diagnosis through rectal manometry and rectal biopsy
CLINICAL PEARLS
Soapsuds, tap water, and magnesium enemas are not recommended for rectal disimpaction
In children with constipation refractory to treatment, consider Hirschsprung disease
Risk factors for developing chronic constipation: acute constipation, painful defecation,
harsh/too early toilet training
