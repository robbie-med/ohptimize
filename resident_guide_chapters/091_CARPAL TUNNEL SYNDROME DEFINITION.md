91. CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
DEFINITION: Syndrome caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through
the carpal tunnel. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel presumably leading to intraneural
ischemia. The most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Classic pattern includes pain and paresthesias (tingling) in the distribution of the median
nerve (first through third fingers) but may include the entire hand. Symptoms may affect
ulnar nerve distribution (fourth and fifth digits) and wrist. Pain and paresthesias may
radiate proximally to forearm, elbow and shoulder
Symptoms usually occur with activity but are often worse at night. “Flicking” the wrist
typically relieves symptoms
Tinel’s sign: Paresthesias in fingers reproduced when the volar aspect of wrist is tapped by
examiner’s fingers
Phalen’s sign: Symptoms reproduced by full flexion of wrist for 60 seconds
Direct median nerve compression test: Symptoms reproduced with direct pressure over
the carpal tunnel for 60 seconds
Weakness of thumb abduction
Atrophy of thenar eminence (late finding)
Diminished 2-point discrimination and vibratory sensation of the index finger relative to
the little finger (late finding)
ETIOLOGY
Repetitive motion injury (flexor tenosynovitis), poor work ergonomics
Trauma, Colles’ fracture, degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ganglion cyst
Obesity, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, mass
lesions, hyperparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, multiple myeloma, acromegaly, use of
corticosteroids and estrogens
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical diagnosis: History and physical exam (See signs and symptoms above). Most
highly predictive findings are
Symptom location consistent with median nerve distribution
Hypoalgesia (diminished sensitivity to pain along palmar aspect of index finger)
Weak thumb abduction
Electromyography/nerve conduction study: Diagnostic standard for carpal tunnel
syndrome. Helpful when diagnosis uncertain and for determination of severity. EMG/
NCS will show prolonged distal latency of stimulated nerve with reduced sensory nerve
action potential
MRI/ultrasound: Reserved for special concerns including anomalous muscle bellies,
severe synovitis, or nerve tumors
MANAGEMENT
Non-operative: Recommended for 6–12 weeks for mild to moderate symptoms
Splinting: Cockup or neutral position. Usually worn at night or during periods of rest,
but 24-hour wear may be beneficial. Immobilization allows decreased pressure around
nerve, alleviating symptoms in up to 80% of patients
Oral corticosteroids: More effective than placebo/NSAIDs. Dose used in studies is
Prednisone 20mg PO daily for 2 weeks then 10mg PO daily for 2 weeks

Corticosteroid injection: See Chapter 93, Corticosteroid Injection of Joints. Long term
efficacy is questionable but works well to relieve local ischemia and reduce synovial
swelling in the carpal tunnel. Many patients relapse despite initial improvement
NSAIDs/diuretics/pyridoxine: No more effective than placebo
Therapeutic ultrasound, magnetic therapy: Poor evidence, recommended against
Lifestyle modifications: Less evidence but may help. Avoiding repetitive motions,
utilizing ergonomic equipment (wrist rest, mouse pads), work breaks, keyboard
alternatives (digital pen, voice recorder/dictation software)
Operative: Recommended after failure of non-operative measures or if axonal loss
is suspected (constant numbness, symptoms > 12 months, thenar muscle atrophy or
weakness). Involves release of transverse carpal ligament either open or endoscopically
Provides relief in > 95% of patients
Progress to full utilization in 4–6 weeks
Prevention
Hourly breaks while performing repetitive work, ergonomic changes as above
Padded gloves to protect the carpal tunnel from vibration and trauma
