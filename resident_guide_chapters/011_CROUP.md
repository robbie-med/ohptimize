11. CROUP (ACUTE LARYNGOTRACHEITIS)
DEFINITION: A viral illness causing inflammation leading to narrowing of the upper airway
characterized by “barky” cough, inspiratory stridor and hoarse voice
PRESENTATION
Typically occurs in children ages 6 months–3 years. Symptoms are frequently preceded by
coryza, fever, and pharyngitis with sudden onset of barky cough that is worse at night. Most
common in late autumn to early winter
Signs and symptoms
Mild croup: Barky cough, no stridor at rest or stridor with agitation, and no intercostal
retractions
Moderate croup: Frequent barky cough, audible stridor at rest, mild intercostal
retractions, mild tachypnea, and no mental status change
Severe croup: Frequent barky cough, prominent inspiratory stridor at rest, marked
sternal wall retractions, decreased air entry on auscultation, respiratory distress, and
may or may not include mental status change
Differential diagnosis
Epiglottitis
Foreign body aspiration
Bacterial tracheitis
Subglottic stenosis
Spasmodic croup
Retro/parapharyngeal abscess
ETIOLOGY
Viral
Parainfluenza viruses (most common), Rhinovirus, Influenza viruses, RSV and
Adenovirus
Enteroviruses (coxsackievirus A & B and echovirus)
Measles virus (endemic areas)
Bacterial: Mycoplasma pneumoniæ
EVALUATION: The diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis. Ancillary testing is not routinely
needed, but may be indicated in patients who appear toxic, fail to respond to treatment, or if
there is diagnostic uncertainty
PA and lateral neck x-rays
“Steeple sign:” Common x-ray finding secondary to subglottic narrowing
“Thumb sign:” Identifies epiglottitis as an etiology, but lack of “thumb sign” does not
rule out epiglottitis
Other: Pulse oximetry monitoring may be helpful in identifying severe respiratory
distress, but it is not sensitive in assessing the severity of croup
MANAGEMENT:
Dexamethasone: 0.6mg/kg IM or PO as a one time dose for all patients with viral
croup regardless of severity. Associated with fewer return visits, hospitalizations,
and endotracheal intubations. Also, improves clinical course and shortens duration of
symptoms

PEDS
For moderate to severe croup: Racemic epinephrine 2.25% inhalation (0.5mg/mL
nebulized) diluted in 3mL NS. Reduces airway inflammation allowing steroids to take
effect. Observe patients for 2–4 hours post treatment for recurrence of symptoms. Racemic
epinephrine lasts only 2 hours; if patient worsens, consider repeat racemic epinephrine and
admission
Inhalation of humidified air (vaporizer): Commonly used in clinical practice but has not
been shown to be effective in clinical trials
Increase fluid intake, decrease agitation, observe carefully, follow-up closely
Indications for admission
Stridor at rest
Low oxygen saturation
Tachypnea/retractions
Ill appearance, poor color, decreased level of consciousness
Questionable diagnosis (possible epiglottis, foreign body, etc.)
Administration of more than one dose of racemic epinephrine
CLINICAL PEARLS
Croup is typically preceded by a viral prodrome or URI symptoms
Racemic epinephrine has an onset of action of 10–30 minutes
Consider alternative diagnosis in patients with persistent or worsening symptoms despite
appropriate treatment
Hypoxemia is uncommon in otherwise healthy children with croup and should be viewed
as a warning sign of possible respiratory failure
