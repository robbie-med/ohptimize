HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM
History

Rectal bleeding (melena vs. bright red blood mixed with stool), weight loss, and
abdominal bloating or cramping
Past medical history
Previous patterns of bowel activity
Current medications
History of malignancy or radiation therapy
Previous surgeries
Physical exam
Abdomen: Note any surgical scars. Palpate for masses (stool) and
hepatosplenomegaly. Check for hernia. Examination results are often normal
Neurologic: Neuro exam if necessary
Rectal: Assess for anal wink. Digital examination to assess rectal tone and presence
of pain (anal fissure). Palpate for rectal masses, stool impaction, leakage. Fecal occult
stool
ETIOLOGIES
Medications: Opiate analgesics, antihypertensives (calcium channel blockers), iron,
calcium, barium, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antispasmodics, antiparkinson
medications, antacids
Neurologic dysfunction: Hirschsprung’s disease, neurofibromatosis, autonomic
neuropathy, Chagas disease, spinal cord lesions, multiple sclerosis, CVA, Parkinson’s
disease
Metabolic and endocrine: Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia,
hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, pregnancy
Collagen vascular diseases: Amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy
Mechanical difficulties:Colorectal cancer, hernia, diverticulitis, irritable bowel,
hemorrhoids, anal fissure, or stricture
EVALUATION: Direct evaluation based on findings in history and physical exam and not
routinely indicated
Blood chemistry: Blood glucose, serum electrolytes, calcium, and TSH
Fecal occult blood test: Perform during examination if indicated
Alarm signs such as hematochezia, weight loss, anemia, acute onset warrants endoscopic
evaluation

This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Lubiprostone (Amitiza):
Activates chloride channel to enhance intestinal fluid secretion
Indicated for chronic idiopathic constipation and opioid-induced constipation in
adults with noncancer pain
Dose: 24mcg BID with food
Common adverse events: Nausea, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain and
distention, and flatulence
Pregnancy Category C: A negative pregnancy test prior to beginning therapy is
advised
Methylnaltrexone (Relistor)
Selective antagonist of opioid binding at the mµ-opioid receptor
Opioid-induced constipation in patients with cancer pain
Dose: 38kg to < 62kg–8mg SC every other day; 62kg to 114kg–12mg SC every
other day; for weight falling outside those ranges–0.15mg/kg every other day
Common adverse reactions: abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea
and hyperhidrosis
CLINICAL PEARLS
New onset of constipation is a warning sign for cancer. Screen for colon cancer with
selected patients
Consider irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as the cause of constipation
Fecal impaction is often a common cause of constipation in the elderly
