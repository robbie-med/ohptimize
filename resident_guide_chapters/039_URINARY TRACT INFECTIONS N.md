39. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Note: For children, See Chapter 15, Urinary Tract Infections in Children
ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
General: Approximately 7 million office visits/year with direct costs of $1.8 billion
annually
Etiology: E. coli (85% of cases), Staph saprophyticus (10%), Proteus, Klebsiella,
Pseudomonas
Upper urinary tract disease: Since up to 30% of patients diagnosed with cystitis-
like syndrome may have subclinical upper tract disease, they need to be questioned for
symptoms of complicated UTI, including fever, back pain, symptoms > 1 week, vomiting,
or hematuria
Dysuria as chief complaint can also be urethritis or vaginitis
Factors which increase the likelihood of UTI include urgency, frequency, hematuria,
back pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and suprapubic pain or pressure
Factors which decrease the probability of UTI include absence of dysuria, absence of
back pain, history of vaginal discharge or vaginal irritation, and vaginal discharge on
exam
Evaluation
Urine dipstick/urinalysis: Can indicate likelihood of infection. Should obtain mid-
stream clean catch specimen. Leukocyte esterase is sensitive but not specific. Nitrate
is less sensitive but more specific. Note: Urine dipstick or screen is more accurate if
combined with pretest and post-test probabilities based on history and physical exam
Urinalysis is suggestive of UTI if
Greater than 5 WBC per high power field (HPF)
Bacteriuria is present
Nitrite is positive
Note: False positives occur with leukocyte esterase because of vaginal leukocytes
Note: Presence of squamous epithelial cells (> 4/HPF) suggests contamination or
non-clean catch specimen
Urine culture: Consider if strong likelihood of UTI despite negative point-of-care
urinalysis, atypical clinical features, suggestion of a complicated UTI, pediatric
or immunosuppressed patient, recurrent UTIs, or has had recent antibiotics. Local
resistance patterns for common pathogens vary, may be useful to avoid treatment with
antibiotics ineffective for causative agent
Follow-up: For uncomplicated UTIs, no follow-up culture or visit is necessary unless
symptoms persist, recur, or patient is pregnant
Management
Duration of therapy
3 day antibiotic course is as effective as 7 day course, with less antibiotic-related
side-effects. Single dose therapy is not recommended
A 7–14 day antibiotic course is recommended for an uncomplicated UTI if patient
is: Diabetic, > 65 years-old, febrile, pregnant (7 day courses), has had a UTI
within 6 weeks, has had symptoms > 7 days, or is a diaphragm user
First-line antibiotics: Choice should be based on patient allergy and compliance
history, local practice patterns, local resistance prevalence, availability, cost, and
tolerance
Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) 100mg BID × 5 days (with meals)
156
ID
Minimal E. coli resistance. Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected or CrCl <
30mL/minute (poor renal penetration)
Pregnancy Category B
Side-effects: Nausea, headache, flatulence
TMP/SMX (Bactrim, Septra) 1 DS tab (160/800mg) BID × 3 days
93% efficacy. Avoid if resistance is > 20% or if used for UTI in previous 3
months
Pregnancy Category C
Side-effects: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, rash, urticaria, hematologic
complications, and photosensitivity
Fosfomycin (Monurol) 3g sachet in a single dose
91% efficacy based on 1 trial, but it appears to be less effective than TMP/
SMX or fluoroquinolones.Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected
Pregnancy Category B
Side-effects: Diarrhea, nausea, headache, and vaginitis
Second-line antibiotics
Fluoroquinolones: More expensive. Use if local resistance to TMP/SMX is high
and for patients with recurrent, chronic or complicated UTIs. Not for use in
pregnant women or if patients aged < 18 years
90% (85–98%) efficacy. Resistance prevalence in the U.S. is rising and high
prevalence in some regions in the world
Pregnancy Category C
Side-effects include N/V, diarrhea, headache, drowsiness and insomnia
Dosing
Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) 250mg BID × 3 days
Ciprofloxacin extended release (Cipro XR) 500mg daily × 3 days
Levofloxacin (Levaquin) 250mg daily × 3 days
Ofloxacin (Floxin) 200mg daily × 3 days or 400mg single dose
β-lactam antibiotics
89% (79–98%) efficacy; may be less effective than TMP/SMX or
Fluoroquinolones. Few efficacy data on first generation cephalosporins
(e.g., Cephalexin); avoid empirical Amoxicillin or Ampicillin due to high
prevalence of resistance. Check local resistance patterns
Pregnancy Category B
Side-effects: Diarrhea, N/V, rash, and urticaria
Dosing
Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Augmentin) 500/125mg BID × 7 days
Cefpodoxime (Vantin) 100mg BID × 7 days
Cefdinir (Omnicef) 300mg BID × 10 days
Relief of dysuria
Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) 100–200mg TID × 2 days
Side-effects include headache, rash, pruritus, GI disturbance, urine
discoloration, and staining of contact lenses
Pregnancy Category B
Warn patients about urine turning reddish-orange!
ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED PYELONEPHRITIS
Signs and symptoms
Dysuria, frequency, urgency
CVA/back pain
Fever/chills/malaise
Abdominal pain
Nausea/vomiting/anorexia
Etiology: E. coli—80%, also Klebsiella, Staph saprophyticus, Enterobacter
Evaluation: Urinalysis and consider culture. Pyuria almost always present, gram negative
bacteria, WBC casts may be present
157
ID
Indications for hospitalization
Nausea/vomiting/Unable to tolerate PO fluids
Toxic appearing (hemodynamic instability)
Comorbid conditions (e.g., renal dysfunction, urologic disorders, DM)
Pregnancy
Immunosuppression
Metabolic derangement (renal dysfunction, acidosis)
Very high fever (> 103°F (39.4°C))
Outpatient treatment
Fluoroquinolones
Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID or Cipro XR 1g daily × 7 days
Levofloxacin 750mg daily × 5 days
TMP-SMX 160/800mg (1 DS tab) BID × 14 days
Oral β-lactams × 10–14 days. Use only when other recommended agents cannot
be used. If it is used, an initial IV dose of 1g Ceftriaxone or a 24-hour dose of
Aminoglycoside is recommended
COMPLICATED UTI'S
Complicated UTI's occur in the presence of structural abnormalities and in certain patient
populations. In these cases, pathogens are more variable and may be more resistant to
antibiotics
Abnormalities may include vesicourethral reflux, stones or obstruction
Patient populations at risk include patients with diabetes, sickle cell disease,
polycystic kidneys, renal transplant recipients, patients on immunosuppressive
therapy, pregnancy, neurologically impaired, or presence of indwelling catheter/stent/
nephrostomy tube
Evaluation: Obtain urinalysis and urine cultures and sensitivities
Treatment with Fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX (as above): Begin while awaiting
culture and sensitivities. Once susceptibilities are available, therapy should be tailored.
Hospitalization: Severely ill patients should be hospitalized and covered for Pseudomonas
and Enterococcus
Consider referral to subspecialists including urology, infectious disease or nephrology
RECURRENT URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Definition: > 2 infections in 6 months > 3 infections in 1 year
Epidemiology: Occurs in ~20% of young women
Etiology: 90% due to exogenous reinfection, typically months apart. Rarely due to
anatomic or functional abnormalities or urinary tract, so imaging studies are of little
use. Inquire about hygiene, diaphragm use, wiping pattern (back to front) and use of
hot tubs. If diaphragm/spermicide use, consider another form of contraception
Evaluation: Obtain culture and sensitivity
Management
Initial recurrence is same treatment as uncomplicated cystitis. Initiate with a broader-
spectrum antibiotic such as a TMP/SMX or Fluoroquinolone
Episodes of UTIs that occur at least 1 month after successful treatment of a UTI
should be treated with a first-line short-course regimen
If the recurrence is within 6 months, consider a first-line agent other than the one that
was used originally, especially if TMP/SMX was used, because of possible resistance
Non-antibiotic preventive strategies (mixed evidence of efficacy)
Abstinence or reduction in frequency of intercourse
If spermicides are used, change to another method of contraception
Change behaviors: Urinate soon after intercourse, drink fluids liberally, not
routinely delay urination, wipe front to back after defecation, avoid tight-fitting
underwear, avoid douching
Topical Estrogen
Antibiotic prophylaxis: Reduces risk of recurrence by about 95%
158
ID
Self-diagnosis and self-treatment: A first-line antibiotic regimen is prescribed for
future use. The patient is educated to take it at onset of UTI symptoms
Postcoital antibiotic prophylaxis: Single dose of antibiotic as soon as feasible after
intercourse
Nitrofurantoin 50–100mg
TMP/SMX 40/200mg or 80/400mg
TMP 100mg
Cephalexin 250mg
Cipro 125mg
Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis: Daily bedtime dose (except Fosfomycin)
Nitrofurantoin 50–100mg
TMP/SMX 40/200mg (3×/week is also effective)
TMP 100mg
Cephalexin 125–250mg
Cipro 125mg
Fosfomycin 3g every 10 days
Long-term exposure to Nitrofurantoin may cause rare toxic effects which
include pulmonary hypersensitivity, chronic hepatitis, and peripheral
neuropathy
UTI'S IN YOUNGER MEN
Rare if < 50 years-old. It used to be thought that UTI's in men were caused by urologic
abnormalities, but now studies suggest that these UTI's are due to the same strains of E.
coli that affect women. Need to differentiate from prostatitis and STD by obtaining a good
sexual history and performing a rectal exam
Patients present with symptoms of cystitis but may mimic urethritis with urethral dis-
charge. Obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity on all patients. If there is urethral
discharge, obtain culture before obtaining urine specimen
Risk factors: Homosexuality, sexual partner with vaginal colonization by uropathogen,
immunosuppressed patients, bladder outlet obstruction, lack of circumcision
Adult men who respond to antibiotics with their first UTI do NOT need further urologic
evaluation. Subsequent UTIs do need further work-up
If indicated, further work-up includes renal ultrasound, IVP, helical CT, or
cystourethrogram
Treat with 7–14 day course of antibiotics. Avoid nitrofurantoin and β-lactams since do
not achieve reliable tissue concentration
CATHETER-ASSOCIATED URINARY TRACT INFECTION (CA-UTI)
Prevention: Sterile insertion, prompt removal, and use of a closed collecting system
Bacteriuria: If catheter is in > 30 days, most patients will have bacteriuria
Intermittent catheterization has resulted in lower rates of bacteriuria than long-term
indwelling catheter
Distinguish between bacteriuria and infection (pain, fever, CVA tenderness, etc.)
Management
If the catheter has been in place > 2 weeks at the onset of CA-UTI and is still
indicated, the catheter should be replaced. Obtain urine culture from the freshly placed
catheter prior to antibiotic therapy
If use of the catheter can be discontinued, obtain a culture of a voided midstream urine
specimen prior to the antibiotic therapy to help guide treatment
Urine cultures are used to confirm that an empiric therapy provides appropriate
coverage and to allow tailoring of therapy base on susceptibility data
Antibiotic treatment is indicated for symptomatic patients with culture showing >
100,000 CFU. Treat with a Fluoroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin)
No treatment for patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotic treatment may
be considered in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria that persists 48 hours after
removal of a short-term indwelling catheter
159
ID
Duration of treatment
7 days for patients with CA UTI who have prompt resolution of symptoms and
10–14 days for those with a delayed response, regardless of whether the patient
remains catheterized or not
5-day regimen of Levofloxacin for patients with CA-UTI who are not severely ill
3-day antibiotic regimen for women aged ≤65 years who develop CA-UTI
without upper UTI symptoms after an indwelling catheter has been removed
ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA
Treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to traumatic urologic procedures with
mucosal bleeding
Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria are at an increased risk for adverse
outcome
Pregnant women should be screened for bacteriuria by urine culture at least once in
early pregnancy
They should be treated if test results are positive
Oral antibiotics: Amoxicillin/Clavulanate, Cefuroxime (Ceftin), or Nitrofurantoin
The duration of antibiotic therapy should be 3–7 days
Periodic screening for recurrent bacteriuria should be undertaken following therapy
CLINICAL PEARLS
Dysuria may also be secondary to urethritis infections, irritant, contact, vaginitis,
prostatitis, renal stone, hematuria, or concentrated urine
Leukocytes and/or leukocyte esterase may be from vaginal leukocytes and not from cystitis
Obtain UA, urine culture, and susceptibility before empiric treatment with antibiotics
