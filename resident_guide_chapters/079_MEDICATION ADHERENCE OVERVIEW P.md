79. MEDICATION ADHERENCE
OVERVIEW
Patient adherence to a medication regimen is essential to good patient outcomes
Statistics
Approximately 1 in 5 new prescriptions are never filled
According to a WHO 2003 report, about 50% of patients with chronic diseases do not
take their medication as prescribed
Of all the medication-related hospitalizations in the U.S., ⅓to ½ of them are the result
of poor medication adherence
The direct health care costs associated with nonadherence is estimated to be
approximately $100–$300 billion annually
Increasing medication adherence could improve the health outcomes and reduce the
economic burdens of many diseases
UNDERSTANDING MEDICATION ADHERENCE
Medication adherence describes medication taking behavior
There are different forms of nonadherence
Initiate: Patient does not initiate treatment. According to the American Heart
Association (AHA), 24% of patients who suffer a heart attack do not fill their
medications within 7 days of discharge
Implement: Patient delays, omits or takes extra doses
Persist: Patient discontinues treatment. The AHA Facts Sheet described 34% of heart
attack patients with multiple prescriptions stop taking at least one of them within one
month of discharge
Medication-taking behavior is complex and is influenced by multiple factors along the
continuum of care, relating to the patient, providers, and health systems
Factors affecting medication adherence

ASSESSING MEDICATION NONADHERENCE
There are many ways to measure medication adherence
Direct methods: e.g., blood levels, urine metabolites
Indirect methods: Self-report, electronic devices, pharmacy refills and prescription
claims databases, clinical outcomes, pill count, healthcare provider’s report,
interviewing with family members
In the clinical setting, a combination of prescription refills rate and patient interview is a
practical approach
When interviewing patients, use the following techniques
Ask an open-ended question about the patient’s medication habits. Example: “Tell me
how you are taking your medications”
Create a non-judgmental environment in which the patient feels safe admitting to
nonadherence. Example: “You are taking a lot of medicines. It is hard for anyone to
keep them straight. Not only that, they can be expensive”
Explain that it is important for health care providers to get accurate information about
patient medication adherence to make appropriate treatment decisions. Example:
"Your blood sugar is still high. But before you get more medicine, let’s make sure
there isn’t problem taking the medicine that you’ve already been taking. Taking too
much isn’t good either."
Ask about medication adherence last. Example: "I know it must be difficult to take all
your medications regularly. How often do you miss taking them?"
MEDICATION ADHERENCE STRATEGIES
Multilevel interventions are needed to decrease barriers at patient, provider, and systems
levels
Some of the strategies used to improve medication adherence at the provider level are
described below
Understand patient’s knowledge and perception, as well as address confusion and
uncertainty. The educational content provided must be appropriate for patient’s level
of health literacy and cultural context. Education should be aligned with the patient’s
readiness to make a behavioral change and build incrementally on patient’s existing
knowledge base. Patient education may be delivered and/or reinforced by other
members of the clinical care team
Address medication-related factors
Choose lower cost medications. Use generic drugs or generic therapeutic
alternatives when possible. Lower prescription number
Minimize medication complexity. Choose once-a-day and combination
medications
Monitor side-effects of drugs at office visits and at prescription renewals. Address
the challenges with treatment adherence
Show effectiveness of the medications. Provide patients with tools for self-
monitoring (e.g., booklets to record blood pressure or blood sugar readings, free
blood pressure or blood sugar monitor)
For patients with unintentional nonadherence, use of pillboxes, medication list,
and external reminder can be effective
Monitor medication adherence. Use medication fill history in the HER and payer
medication reports. Educate and review adherence information during visits
Patient counseling and accountability interventions can be delivered as case management,
peer or social support, or telephone or in-person sessions. Counseling helps patients
engaged in their health, provides a forum to address questions, and builds patients' self-
efficacy in their medication-taking behaviors
CLINICAL PEARLS
Medication adherence is a common problem with multiple causes and potential solutions
Clinicians can identify patients at risk for medication nonadherence and initiate strategies
to improve adherence
360
GEN
Some of the common strategies include prescribing lower cost medications and ones that
are easier to take, ensuring that patients understand the benefits and side-effects, using
clinical data to show the effectiveness of medication and empower patients for self-
monitoring of their disease

80. NON-OPIOID MEDICATIONS FOR CHRONIC
NON-CANCER PAIN
OVERVIEW
Chronic pain is defined by the CDC as pain that typically lasts > 3 months or past the
time of normal tissue healing
In the 2012 National Health Interview Study, approximately 11% of adults reported
having daily pain
Chronic non-cancer pain interferes with activities of daily living and has a major
negative impact on quality of life and physical function
Clinicians have long been relying on opioids for treating chronic non-cancer pain, even
though their effectiveness has not been proven. In 2005, approximately 3–4% of Americans
were prescribed long-term opioid therapy
Sales of opioid pain medication have increased in parallel with opioid-related overdose
deaths
In light of the opioid epidemic, clinicians need to optimize nonopioid pharmacotherapy
and non-pharmacologic therapy before offering a trial of opioid to patients with chronic
non-cancer pain
This chapter focuses on the commonly used non-opioid medications for the treatment of
non-cancer pain
NON-OPIOID PHARMACOTHERAPY
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
ACETAMINOPHEN (APAP)
APAP is typically considered first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain conditions,
including osteoarthritis
362
GEN
APAP is equipotent to aspirin in its analgesic and antipyretic potency. Unlike aspirin, it
lacks anti-inflammatory activity and does not inhibit platelet production
It has few adverse events and is considered safe to use chronically
The usual dose is 325–650mg every 4–6 hours. Maximum dose is 3g/day
Daily dose > 4g is associated with serious liver damage. Patients with advanced liver
disease or heavy alcohol use are at increased risk of acetaminophen toxicity
Acetaminophen is available OTC, commonly combined with other analgesics. Patients
should be educated on proper dosing and be aware of any other acetaminophen-containing
medications they may be using
NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS)
NSAIDs are effective for relief of mild to moderate pain, and have an opioid dose-sparing
effect.
Have both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects
Inhibit platelet aggregation and should be avoided if possible in patients with
thrombocytopenia or coagulation defects
Available NSAIDs have similar potency. Patient response varies considerably, so if a
patient does not respond to the maximum dose of one NSAID, another NSAID may be
tried
Dosage information and the maximum recommended dose for the commonly used
NSAIDs are listed in Table below
Avoid NSAIDs that are ≥90% eliminated by the kidney (Fenoprofen, Naproxen,
Ketorolac, Tolmetin) in elderly patients and patients with renal impairment
Avoid oxaprozin and piroxicam in elderly patients due to their long t½ (42–50 hours)
Topical NSAID, diclofenac, can provide good levels of pain relief, equivalent to that of
oral NSAIDs in knee and hand osteoarthritis
NSAIDs bind extensively to plasma proteins and may be displaced by or may displace
other protein-bound drugs such as warfarin, methotrexate, digoxin, cyclosporine, oral
antidiabetic agents, and sulfa drugs
Renal side-effects
NSAIDs decrease renal blood flow, cause fluid retention, and increase blood pressure
NSAIDs may cause acute renal failure
Risk factors include old age, CHF, renal insufficiency, ascites, volume depletion, and
diuretic therapy
Allergic interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome rarely occur
GI side-effects (gastropathy)
Dyspepsia is the most common GI side-effect (15–20%). If GI upset occurs, take with
meals or milk
Chronic use of NSAIDs can lead to GI bleeding, ulceration and perforation, often
without warning, FDA requires all over-the-counter NSAID products to carry a
warning label concerning chronic alcohol use (≥3 drinks/day) and risk of GI bleeding
Risk factors for GI complications include old age, history of ulcer, serious
cardiovascular disease, high doses, prolonged use, concomitant use of steroid or
anticoagulants, and excessive alcohol use
Proton-pump inhibitors, such as Prilosec and Prevacid, may be used to treat active
ulcer and prevent NSAID ulcers
Misoprostol 200mcg 4 ×/day (Cytotec) is approved for the prevention of NSAID-
induced gastric ulcers. It is also available as a combination product with diclofenac
(Arthrotec). Common side-effects of misoprostol include diarrhea (13–40%),
abdominal pain (7–20%), nausea (3%), and flatulence (3%). It can cause miscarriage
and should not be used during pregnancy
Cardiovascular thrombotic events
NSAIDs interfere with the cardioprotective effect of aspirin. NSAIDs also have some
prothrombotic effects
Naproxen is the preferred NSAID in patients with cardiovascular disease
COX-2 Inhibitors
363
GEN
The selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib (Celebrex), is equal to NSAIDs for treating
pain, but has a safer GI profile and is considered as an alternative to the traditional,
less selective NSAIDs. Like NSAIDs, it is associated with increased cardiovascular
risk
Dosing information for celecoxib is described in Table below
Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergy
ANTICONVULSANTS
The best evidence supports the use of gabapentin, pregabalin, and carbamazepine or
oxcarbazepine for chronic non-cancer pain
Anticonvulsants should be initiated at a low dose with gradual increase until pain relief. A
minimal duration of 4–6 weeks may be needed in order to adequately assess effectiveness
Gabapentin (Neurontin, generic)
MOA: Structurally related to GABA but does not bind to GABA receptors. It
selectively binds to alpha-2-delta-1 subunit protein of calcium channels in the brain
and spinal cord, thereby inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters for pain
Gabapentin is approved by the FDA for postherpetic neuralgia and partial onset
seizures. However, it has been shown to be effective in diabetic neuropathy and
fibromyalgia
Pregabalin (Lyrica)
Classified as a Schedule V controlled substance in the U.S.
MOA: Same as gabapentin. Pregabalin can diffuse across the blood-brain barriers and
may provide analgesia more quickly than gabapentin
Indications: same as gabapentin but additionally approved for 1) neuropathic pain
associated with diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury; 2) fibromyalgia
When discontinuing, taper off gradually over at least 1 week
Carbamazepine (Tegretol, generic)
MOA: Acts on the peripheral sodium channels and emit their analgesic effect by
blocking synaptic conduction at the trigeminal nucleus
Carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. However, it has
also been used off-label in neuropathic pain. It may not be as effective as gabapentin
or pregabalin for neuropathic pain and it is generally considered as second-line agent
because of its adverse effect profile
Obtain a complete blood count and baseline liver function tests prior to starting
patients on carbamazepine, in 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter
Blood levels do not correlate with pain efficacy but may be helpful in assessing
medication adherence
Be aware of many potential drug interactions due to hepatic enzymes induction of this
drug
Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)
MOA: A carbamazepine derivative
Oxcarbazepine is used off-label for the treatment of neuropathic pain, typically when
patients failed other agents
Oxcarbazepine has a more favorable side-effect profile than carbamazepine
Like carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine is a 3A4 inducer and can interact with many drugs
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen (paracetamol):

GEN
ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Antidepressants with mixed receptor or noradrenergic activity appear to have the
greatest analgesic effect in patients with neuropathic pain
Antidepressants are useful in patients who have comorbid pain and psychiatric conditions
Refer to Table below for dosing information and side-effect profiles
Tricyclic antidepressants
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are commonly used as first-line therapies in patients
with neuropathic pain. They may be less effective in low back pain
MOA: TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, which influence
descending pain pathway
Secondary amines TCAs such as nortriptyline (Pamelor) and desipramine
(Norpramin) show relatively selective inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake
Tertiary amines TCAs such as amitriptyline and imipramine (Tofranil) show
more balanced inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin, but also have greater
anticholinergic side-effects
TCAs are not approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic pain
TCAs use lower doses for chronic pain than those used in depression
Most side-effects are due to the anticholinergic profile of TCAs. Tertiary amines have
greater anticholinergic side-effects and should not be used in elderly patients
TCAs are contraindicated in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, recent
cardiac events, and narrow-angle glaucoma
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)
There are four SNRIs available in the U.S.: Venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine,
and milnacipran
Venlafaxine (Effexor XR, generic)
It has been evaluated in controlled trials and meta-analyses for the treatment of
diabetic neuropathy demonstrating favorable effects in pain intensity and relief
Venlafaxine is currently not approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy;
however, it is often considered as a second-line option
Effects of venlafaxine are dose dependent: Serotoninergic properties in dosages
< 150mg/day; mixed serotoninergic and noradrenergic properties in dosages >
150mg/day
A treatment duration of 4–6 weeks is needed to assess effectiveness
Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) is the main active metabolite of venlafaxine and has similar
side-effect profile as venlafaxine. However, desvenlafaxine is only approved for the
treatment of depression and it has not been adequately evaluated for its use in chronic
pain
Duloxetine (Cymbalta, generic)
Among the SNRIs, duloxetine has the most indications for pain management
In addition to indications for depression and generalized anxiety disorder, it
has been approved for the management of diabetic neuropathic pain, chronic
musculoskeletal pain (including chronic low back pain and OA of knee), and
fibromyalgia
Milnacipran (Savella)
Milnacipran is approved only for the treatment of fibromyalgia but not for
depression
Even though not used as an antidepressant, milnacipran still has the Boxed
Warnings for suicide risk as all antidepressants
Cost may be an issue as there is no generic form of milnacipran available in the
U.S.
When discontinuing an antidepressant, gradual tapering is recommended to avoid
withdrawal symptoms
SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS
Skeletal muscle relaxants are widely used in the treatment of low back pain. Current
studies support using skeletal muscle relaxants only for short-term relief of acute low back
365
GEN
pain when acetaminophen or NSAIDs are not effective or tolerated
Cyclobenzaprine
Cyclobenzaprine is the most studied muscle relaxant and has been shown to be
effective in various musculoskeletal disorders. It has the greatest benefit within the
first few days of treatment. As a result, it is FDA approved for the relief of spasms
associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions
Cyclobenzaprine has also been studied in the treatment of fibromyalgia. It moderately
improved sleep and pain, but long-term benefits were unknown. Currently, it is often
used off-label for fibromyalgia
The mechanisms of action of cyclobenzaprine is unclear and could be related in part to
sedative effects
Cyclobenzaprine is structurally similar to TCAs. It also has some serotonergic
antagonism at the 5-HT2 receptor
The dose starts at 5mg TID (10mg nightly for fibromyalgia) and can be titrated to a
maximum dose of 10mg TID
The most common side-effects are dizziness and drowsiness. It can also cause
anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary
retention. Similar to TCAs, cardiac arrhythmias are possible
The sedative properties of cyclobenzaprine may benefit patients with insomnia caused
by severe muscle spasms
TOPICAL AGENTS
Capsaicin
Capsaicin is an alkaloid derived from chili pepper. It depletes and prevents
reaccumulation of substance P in peripheral sensory neurons
Capsaicin is available OTC as cream (Zostrix 0.025% or 0.075%)
Capsaicin cream is approved for temporary relief of musculoskeletal pains
Current evidence suggests that capsaicin cream is probably effective in patients
with diabetic neuropathy. It is often used as an adjunctive therapy
Capsaicin cream must be applied 3–4 times daily over a period of 2–4 weeks
before optimal pain relief can be achieved
Avoid contact with eyes and mucous members. Wash hands thoroughly with soap
and water immediately after use
Capsaicin is also available as a high concentration (8%) patch (Qutenza)
Currently, capsaicin 8% patch is only indicated for the management of
postherpetic neuralgia
A Cochrane review has determined that there is very low quality evidence that
Capsaicin 8% patch benefits those with HIV-neuropathy and peripheral diabetic
neuropathy
Capsaicin 8% patch can only be applied by a physician or healthcare provider to
the most painful area for 60 minutes. Four patches can be used at one time. The
treatment can be repeated ≥3 months as needed
The major side-effects of capsaicin are burning, stinging, and erythema
Topical lidocaine
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is available in patches, sprays, and cream
Currently, there is no strong evidence to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat
neuropathic pain. However, individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief
of pain
Lidocaine 5% patch (Lidoderm) is indicated for treating postherpetic neuralgia
Dosing: Apply up to 3 patches to the affected area in a single application. The patch
may remain in place up to 12 hours/24 hours
Local skin reactions are common
Topical NSAIDs
Topical NSAIDs, diclofenac gel and solution, are mainly used to relieve osteoarthritis
pain. Diclofenac patch is approved to treat acute pain due to minor strains, sprains, and
contusions
366
GEN
No direct comparison between the various topical diclofenac formulations has been
performed. In clinical practice, the drug formulation is chosen based on patient
preference
CLINICAL PEARLS
Chronic pain involves a complex interaction of physiological, emotional, cognitive, social
and environment factors
Treatment often requires multidisciplinary approaches including drugs; interventions such
as nerve blocks, surgery, implantable drug-delivery systems, and spinal-cord stimulators;
exercise and physical rehabilitation; psychological treatments, and complementary
medicines
Management of chronic pain should include dialogue with the patient about realistic
expectation of pain relief and bring focus to improvement of function
Drug selection should be based on efficacy, side-effects contraindications, coexisting
conditions and cost. The selected drug should be initiated at low doses and titrate
gradually to avoid adverse effects
The American Diabetes Association recommends either pregabalin or duloxetine as initial
drug therapy for diabetic neuropathic pain
