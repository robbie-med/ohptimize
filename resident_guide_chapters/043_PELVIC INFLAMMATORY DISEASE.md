43. PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE (PID)
GENERAL
One million cases per year in the U.S.
Long-term sequelae include infertility, increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, chronic pain
RISK FACTORS
Multiple sex partners
History of STDs
Substance abuse
Frequent vaginal douching
Young age
IUD use
HISTORY: Lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, dysuria,
fever, nausea/vomiting. Inquire about risk factors listed above
PHYSICAL EXAM: Fever, lower abdominal tenderness (bilateral vs. unilateral), vaginal
discharge, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness
CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PID: Initiate treatment in women at risk for STDs if they
are having pelvic or lower abdominal pain with at least one of the minimum criteria and an
alternate diagnosis cannot be found
Minimum criteria
Uterine or adnexal tenderness (bilateral or unilateral)
Cervical motion tenderness (CMT) without any other explanation
Acute adnexal tenderness-sensitive sign of upper genital tract infection
Supportive: Additional criteria which enhance specificity
Oral temperature > 101°F (> 38.3°C)
Abnormal cervical or vaginal mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability
Presence of abundant numbers of WBC on saline microscopy of vaginal secretions
Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
Elevated C-reactive protein
Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis
PATHOGENS: Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeæ, Gram negative facultative bacteria
(e.g., E. coli), anaerobes, Streptococcus, Mycoplasma, Actinomyces, G. Vaginalis, H. Influenzæ
INDICATIONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION FOR ACUTE PID
Patient is pregnant
Patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy
Patient is unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen
Patient has severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high fever
Patient has a tubo-ovarian abscess
MANAGEMENT
Parenteral
Recommended regimen. Note: Oral and IV Doxycycline have similar bioavailability
and should be given orally if possible. Choose one of the following
Cefotetan 2g IV every 12 hours —AND— Doxycycline 100mg PO or IV every 12 hours
174
ID
Cefoxitin 2g IV every 6 hours —AND— Doxycycline 100mg PO or IV every 12
hours
Clindamycin 900mg IV every 8 hours—AND— Gentamicin Loading dose IV or
IM (2mg/kg of body weight), followed by a maintenance dose (1.5mg/kg) every 8
hours. Single daily dosing (3–5 mg/kg) may be substituted
Alternative regimen
Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3g IV every 6 hours —AND— Doxycycline 100mg PO or
IV every 12 hours
Oral: Can be considered for mild-moderate disease. If no response to treatment within 72
hours should consider changing to IV treatment
Recommended regimen (choose one of the following)
Ceftriaxone 250mg IM in a single dose—AND— Doxycycline 100mg PO BID for
14 days —WITH or WITHOUT—
Cefoxitin 2g IM in a single dose plus Probenecid 1g PO administered concurrently
in a single dose—AND— Doxycycline 100mg PO BID for 14 days
Another parenteral 3rd generation cephalosporin —AND— Doxycycline 100mg
PO BID for 14 days
Should consider addition of Metronidazole: 500mg PO BID for 14 days to all above
regimens, as 3rd generation cephalosporins have limited anaerobic coverage
FOLLOW-UP
Within 72 hours: Patients should demonstrate significant clinical improvement within this
time. If not, then additional testing or diagnosis needs to be assessed
Retest 3 months after treatment (regardless of sex partners receiving treatment or not)
Partner needs to be tested and treated: Test both patient and partner for HIV, syphilis,
and counsel on safe sexual practices
CLINICAL PEARLS
Rates of infertility with PID increase with recurrent infections. 15% of patients experience
infertility after one infection, 35% after two infections, and 55% after three infections
Women with HIV are more likely to have PID from Mycoplasma or streptococcus species
as opposed to gonorrhea or chlamydia
Risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased 7–10 times after an episode of PID
Recurrent infection occurs in 20–25% of patients who have had PID
The major contributing factors in the development of PID with IUDs are the number of
sex partners and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. When PID occurs with an IUD
in place, the patient can initially be treated without removing the IUD (should consider
removing if no clinical improvement in 48–72 hours)
