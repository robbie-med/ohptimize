115. ADVANCE CARE PLANNING
Advance care planning (ACP) is an ongoing process involving patients, families, and
healthcare providers to address and reflect on patient goals and values of their medical care.
Advance directives are legal documents that allow patients to maintain autonomy during time
of incapacity or at the end of life
IN THE AMBULATORY SETTING
Recent studies have shown that elderly, chronically ill patients are more satisfied
with their primary care physicians when advanced directives are discussed before the
hospitalization
Encourage all patients to have an advance directive while patient has decisional
capacity. This is especially important for those that are
65 years-old or older (should be part of welcome to Medicare visit)
Serious life-threatening illnesses, such as advanced cancer, end stage organ disease
(heart, lung, kidney, liver failure), AIDS, etc.
Wanting to appoint health care proxy who is not a family member or legally married
to patient
Advance directives should include
Living will: Summary of patient’s preference for future medical care. This may include
specific intervention involving resuscitation, life support measures, pain control, and
hospitalization
Durable power of attorney of health care: Legally appointed person to make medical
decision on patient’s behalf when he/she loses decisional capacity
Code status
Full code: Doing “everything” including chest compressions, intubation, and using
vasopressors (ACLS medications)
Do not resuscitate (DNR): Includes providing continuing medical management,
but no chest compressions or intubation
Comfort care only
Comfort care
Palliative care: Interdisciplinary service focused on symptom management,
including relieving pain and suffering, emotional and physical care, and
establishing goals of care. Can be provided at same time as curative or life-
prolonging treatment
Hospice: Life expectancy is measured in months or less. Curative treatment is no
longer beneficial or desired; focus geared on quality of life
CLINICAL PEARLS
Consider involving other physicians or health care professionals involved in patient’s care
Advance directive documents are state specific. Know specific requirements for your state
Hospital ethics committees are often available for consultation for the most difficult
situations
If there is a disagreement between patient and family, patient’s wishes come first
