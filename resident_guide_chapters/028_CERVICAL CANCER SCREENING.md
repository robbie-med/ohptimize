28. CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING:
INDICATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
INTRODUCTION
Since the introduction of cervical cytology in the United States in the mid-20th century,
cervical cancer, once the most frequent cause of cancer deaths in women, now ranks 14th for
cancer deaths. Due to the implementation of screening with cervical cytology, there has been
a marked reduction in cervical cancer mortality. The incidence of cervical cancer in the U.S.
has decreased by greater than 50% in the last 30 years due to screening. Updated ASCCP
consensus guidelines are primarily risk-based (determined by a combination of current results
and past history). Epidemiologic case series have shown that nearly 100% of cervical cancer
cases test positive for HPV
INDICATIONS AND SCHEDULE INTRODUCTION
The recommendations from ACOG and USPSTF are summarized below:
Screening is still recommended for those vaccinated against HPV. Screening is also
recommended for those who have had a hysterectomy and cervix was not removed
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Risk factors for cervical cancer
Early first intercourse
Large number of lifetime sexual partners
History of STDs, especially human papilloma virus (HPV)
High-risk sexual partners
Cigarette smoking (increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma only, not
adenocarcinoma)
Lack of normal immune response (HIV increases chances of cervical cancer 8–11
times)
High parity
Low socioeconomic status
History of abnormal Pap smear
History of vulvar or vaginal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer
Nonwhite race
[Note: Smoking and HPV are the only independent risk factors to be consistently shown to
have statistical significance in multiple studies]
RECOMMENDED TECHNIQUE FOR PERFORMING PAP SMEAR
Ideally the entire portio should be visualized prior to obtaining smear
Vaginal discharge when present in large quantities should be carefully removed so
epithelium is not disturbed
107
OB-GYN
Portio sample should be obtained first with the spatula and then with the Endo Brush
because of risk of endocervical bleeding interfering with sample collection and drying
Sample collection should be uniformly applied and spray fixative applied. Spray fixative
should be applied from at least 10 inches away to prevent dispersal and destruction of cells
Steps C and D can be interchanged with using the “broom” which obtains both ecto- and
endocervical samples
Perform Gonococcus and Chlamydia cultures next (if indicated), then pelvic exam
TECHNIQUES FOR SCREENING
ThinPrep (FDA approved) uses fluid-based technology. Process removes multiple
contaminants (mucous, small amounts of blood, protein) and allows for a thin even cell
layer on slide
Advantages: Several studies have demonstrated that ThinPrep and other monolayer
systems have lower false negative rates than conventional slide preparations. Studies have
also shown a decrease in unsatisfactory specimens
HPV typing can be performed from the same ThinPrep container as the Pap smear
Disadvantage: There is a slight increase in cost of monolayer preparations over
conventional slides
PATHOLOGY REPORT AND ACTION: A–G below describe the possible descriptive
diagnosis with the 2001 Bethesda System of reporting, updated in 2014
Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy: This finding may specify non-
neoplastic findings including the following. Action should be taken based on the specific
result
Trichomonas vaginalis
Fungal organisms morphologically consistent with Candida species
Shift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis
Bacteria morphologically consistent with Actinomyces species
Cellular changes consistent with herpes simplex virus
Reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation (includes typical repair)
Radiation
Intrauterine contraceptive device
Glandular cells status posthysterectomy
Atrophy
Atypical squamous cells (ASC)
This category may be reported as
Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)—OR—
Atypical cells, cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)
All ASC is considered suggestive of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL); 15–38% of
women will have biopsy proven high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and
0.2–2.7% will have invasive cervical cancer
Action for ASC-US
In women age 21–24, can repeat cytology at 1 year (preferred) or perform reflex
testing for oncogenic HPV types (16, 18 and others). If positive, repeat cytology in
12 months. If negative, resume routine screening
In women > 24 years-old, perform reflex testing for HPV. If HPV is positive, then
perform colposcopy. If negative, then repeat co-testing at 3 years. Instead of HPV
testing, another option is to repeat cytology at 12 months and, if normal, routine
screening may be resumed. If result is ≥ASC, then do colposcopy
Action for ASC-H: Colposcopy, without HPV testing
Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL): May be low grade SIL (LSIL) or high grade SIL
(HSIL)
Low-grade SIL (LSIL): This category includes changes consistent with HPV, mild
dysplasia, or CIN 1 (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia)
These lesions will regress spontaneously in most women
Action: Colposcopy
108
OB-GYN
Special populations
In adults 21–24 years-old with ASC-US, ASC-H, or LSIL, may repeat
cytology at 12 months then perform colposcopy if HSIL or higher. Otherwise,
repeat cytology again at 12 months and perform colposcopy if ASC-US or
higher
In post-menopausal women, may perform colposcopy, obtain reflex HPV
testing, or repeat cytology in 6 and 12 months
Biopsies may be obtained if concern for adenocarcinomas
High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL): HSIL is equivalent to the older
classification of moderate to severe dysplasia, CIN 2 or 3, and Carcinoma in Situ (CIS)
For CIN 2 lesions, it appears that 40 to 58% of lesions will regress if left untreated
while 22% progress to CIN 3, and 5% progress to invasive cancer
Action
Colposcopy of entire cervix and vaginal fornices, with biopsy of all visible
lesions and endocervical curettage
Immediate loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) (except in pregnant
women or adolescents)
Special Populations: Women aged 21–24 years-old—perform colposcopy
Glandular cell abnormalities
May be reported as
Atypical glandular cells (AGC)—either endocervical, endometrial, or NOS as
subcategory
Atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic—either endocervical, endometrial, or
not otherwise specified (NOS) as subcategory
Endocervical Carcinoma in Situ (ACIS)
Adenocarcinoma
Upon further evaluation, either high-grade squamous or glandular abnormalities are
found in 10–39% of women with a finding of AGC on cytology. This replaces the
previous term “atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance”
Action
All AGC categories (except atypical endometrial cells): Colposcopy with cervical
biopsies and ECC, testing for high-risk HPV if not already done, and endometrial
biopsy in women ≥35 years-old or at high risk for endometrial neoplasia
For atypical endometrial cells, perform endometrial and endocervical sampling. If
there is no endometrial pathology, then perform colposcopy
Benign-appearing endometrial cells in women ≥45 years-old: Benign-appearing
endometrial cells on a cervical cytology specimen are reported only in women ≥45
years-old and require evaluation in postmenopausal women; in premenopausal women,
evaluation is needed only in women with abnormal uterine bleeding or risk factors for
endometrial carcinoma
A finding of benign-appearing exfoliated endometrial glandular cells in a cervical
cytology specimen (BEC) does not include atypical endometrial cells, which are
reported as atypical endometrial cells, endometrial
The Bethesda 2014 guidelines advise that the presence of BEC be reported in the
cytology report only in women ≥45 years of age. This is a change from the prior
Bethesda 2001 recommendation, which set the age at ≥40 years
Absent endocervical cell/transformation zone component
Women with this finding are not at an increased risk of cervical neoplasia
ASCCP guidelines advise that women with negative cytology but absent or insufficient
EC/TZ be managed as follows
Women age ≥30 should be managed according to HPV test results
HPV-positive: Genotyping for HPV types 16 and 18 or HPV and cytology co-
testing in 1 year. Results should be managed as per ASCCP guidelines
HPV-negative: patient can resume routine screening
HPV unknown: preferred option is HPV testing. Otherwise, cytology may be
repeated in 3 years
109
OB-GYN
Women ages 21 to 29 years may return to routine screening
Unsatisfactory cytology
In those with unknown HPV or negative HPV (and age ≥25 years), repeat age-based
screening in 2–4 months
In those with HPV positive (unknown genotype) and age ≥25 years, can repeat
screening in 2–4 months or colposcopy
In those with HPV 16, 18, recommend colposcopy
PREGNANCY AND THE ABNORMAL PAP
Management of women with an abnormal cervical cytology in pregnancy should follow
the 2006 Bethesda consensus guidelines:
Women younger than age 20 have a high prevalence of human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection and minimally abnormal cytology tests (atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance [ASC-US], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
[LSIL]). The spontaneous resolution rate of these abnormalities is 90% and the risk of
invasive cancer is very low. Therefore, colposcopy during pregnancy can be omitted,
but cytology should be repeated postpartum
ASC-US and LSIL in pregnant women over the age of 20 years may be managed as in
the nonpregnant patient, with the exception that it is acceptable to defer colposcopy to
at least 6 weeks postpartum
Colposcopy is recommended for all adolescent and non-adolescent women with
atypical squamous cells in which a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cannot
be excluded (ASC-H), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and
atypical glandular cells (AGC)
In pregnancy, the same indications for colposcopy should be followed. If colposcopy is
satisfactory and negative for visible lesions, the colposcopy can be repeated postpartum
without any further evaluation during the pregnancy. If a lesion is visualized, it should
be biopsied. Endocervical curettage (ECC) should NOT be performed during pregnancy.
If biopsy is negative or LGSIL, then repeat colposcopy can be postponed until 6 weeks
postpartum
If a patient has HGSIL on Pap with a satisfactory colposcopy or a biopsy consistent with
HGSIL, colposcopy should be repeated every trimester until delivery and then postpartum
with ECC
Microinvasion on a biopsy will require conization and referral
Consider referral if cervical biopsy needed in pregnancy
HIV POSITIVE FEMALES: The guidelines for cervical cancer screening in women
infected with HIV are
Screening should be initiated within 1 year of the onset of sexual activity regardless of
mode of HIV transmission (e.g., sexual activity, perinatal exposure), but no later than 21
years-old
Cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected women should continue throughout their
lifetime
For HIV-infected women < 30 years-old
Cervical cytology test at the time of initial diagnosis of HIV. Provided the initial
cervical cytology result for young (or newly diagnosed) HIV-infected woman
is normal, the next cervical cytology test should be in 12 months. Some experts
recommend cervical cytology at 6 months after the baseline test
If the results of 3 consecutive cervical cytology tests are normal, follow-up
cervical cytology tests should be every 3 years
For atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cytology: If
reflex HPV testing is positive, colposcopy should be performed. If HPV testing
is not available or not done, repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months. For any result
equal to or more severe than ASC-US on repeat cytology, colposcopy should be
performed
110
OB-GYN
For low-grade squamous epithelial lesion (LSIL) or more severe (including
atypical squamous cells): Cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or atypical glandular cells—
colposcopy should be performed
Co-testing (cervical cytology and HPV test) is not recommended for HIV-infected
women < 30 years-old
For HIV-infected women ≥30 years-old, either cervical cytology only or co-
testing with cervical cytology and HPV testing is acceptable for screening
If screening with cervical cytology alone, the HIV-infected woman should have a
cervical cytology test at the time of HIV diagnosis (baseline), and then every 12
months. Some experts recommend a cervical cytology test at 6 months after the
baseline test
If the results of the 3 consecutive cervical cytology tests are normal, follow-up
cervical cytology tests should be performed every 3 years
For ASC-US cervical cytology: If reflex HPV testing is positive, then colposcopy
should be performed. If HPV testing is not available, repeat cytology in 6 to 12
months. For any result equal to or more severe than ASC-US on repeat cytology,
colposcopy should be performed
For LSIL or more severe (including ASC-H, HSIL, or AGC), regardless of HPV
result, if done: Colposcopy should be performed
If co-testing with cervical cytology and HPV is available, then co-testing can be done
at the time of diagnosis or age 30
Co-tested-negative women (i.e., normal cervical cytology and negative HPV test)
can have their next cervical cancer screening in 3 years
Cytology-negative, HPV-positive: Repeat co-testing in 1 year (unless genotype
testing for 16 or 16/18 is positive). If the initial HPV results identify HPV 16 or
HPV 16/18, then colposcopy is recommended. If either of the co-tests at 1 year
is abnormal (i.e., abnormal cytology or positive HPV), colposcopy should be
performed
Screening frequency
Guidelines from ACOG and USPSTF recommend that women who are infected with
HIV should undergo cervical cytology for cancer screening twice in the first year after
diagnosis of HIV infection and then annually, provided the test results are normal
Two cervical screening assessments initially is prudent for HIV-infected women since
intraepithelial neoplasia is not uncommon and can develop rapidly in these women and
because high-grade lesions may be missed with a single smear
TREATMENT OF SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESIONS
Indications for surgical excision (Cone)
Unsatisfactory colposcopic examination (lesion extends into the cervical canal and is
not visualized)
Pap and colposcopy do not agree
Diagnosis of microinvasive carcinoma based on punch biopsy
Cryosurgery
Laser vaporization techniques
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)/Large Loop excision of
transformation zone (LLETZ): Removal of lesion with tissue diagnosis
Note: After the procedure, all patients will need Pap smears every 3 months × 1 year, every 6
months × 1 year, then every year if follow-up Paps are within normal limits
HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) VACCINATIONS
HPV is so common that almost everyone will be infected with HPV at some point in their
lives. About 14 million people become infected every year. Although most HPV infections
are asymptomatic, some persistent infections can lead to cancer in both men and women.
HPV exposure can occur with any type of intimate sexual contact
In the U.S., HPV infections cause over 17,000 cancers in women and over 9,000 cancers
111
OB-GYN
in men each year
HPV is a double stranded DNA virus—there are over 40 types that infect the genital areas
of women and men
High-risk HPV: Oncogenic and is detected in 99% of cervical cancers
Common types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 82
Low-risk HPV: Responsible for genital warts and condyloma
Common types: 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 72, 81
Three HPV vaccines available: Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9
Common adverse events of HPV vaccine
Syncope: Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination may help
Nausea
Headaches
Ideally, HPV vaccine should be given prior to potential HPV exposure through sexual
activity; however, persons who are sexually active should still be vaccinated according
to the age-based recommendations
HPV vaccine can be given to persons with a history of genital warts, abnormal Pap
test, or positive HPV DNA test
Cervical cancer screening recommendations are unchanged as the vaccine does not
cover all HPV genotypes which cause cancer
HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women as data is limited
If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, the
remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion of pregnancy
Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination
If a vaccine dose has been administered during pregnancy, no intervention is
needed
Cervarix (HPV2), a bivalent HPV (types 16 & 18) vaccine, is indicated to protect
females aged 9 to 25 against cervical cancer (HPV types 16 & 18)
Dosage: 3 dose-series with dose 1 given IM at 0 months, dose 2 given 1–2 months
after dose 1, and dose 3 given 6 months after dose 1
CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination at 11–12 years of age. Minimum age:
9 years
The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of
age who did not get all 3 doses when they were younger
Gardasil (HPV4), a quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine, is indicated to
protect males and females 9 to 26 years of age
Females against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers (HPV types 16 & 18)
Both females and males against anal cancer (HPV types 16 & 18); genital warts
(HPV types 6 & 11); and precancerous lesions (HPV types 6, 11, 16 & 18)
In October 2016, the CDC recommended that 11 to 12 year-olds receive 2 doses
of HPV vaccine at least 6 months apart rather than the previously recommended
3 doses to protect against cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)
infections. This applies to all adolescents 9–14 years-old
CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination at 11 or 12 years-old. Minimum age:
9 years
Catch up schedule for females 15 to 26 years of age and males ages 15 to 22: 3
doses with dose 1 ASAP, dose 2 given 1–2 months after dose 1 and dose 3 at least
24 weeks after dose 1
This vaccine may be given to men 22 through 26 years of age who have not
completed the 3-dose series
It is recommended for men through age 26 who have sex with men or whose
immune system is weakened because of HIV infection, other illness, or
medications
Gardasil (HPV9), a 9-valent vaccine, protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33,
45, 52, and 58. The indications and directions are the same as for HPV4
ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) did not recommend catch-
up vaccinations for all adults aged 27–45, but shared clinical decision-making is
