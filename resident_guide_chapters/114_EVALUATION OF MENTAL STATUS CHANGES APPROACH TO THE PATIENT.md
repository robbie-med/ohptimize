114. EVALUATION OF MENTAL STATUS CHANGES
APPROACH TO THE PATIENT/DEFINITIONS: Historical data is crucial to distinguish
acute vs. chronic change in cognition. Seek collateral information from old records, family
members, and caregivers
Delirium
Definition:Acute decline in baseline attention and cognition
Often initiates cascade of events that may culminate in the loss of independence,
increased mortality, and the inability to return to prior functional status
Dementia
Definition: Chronic disorder characterized by a decline in memory and at least one
other cognitive domain (aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, executive function)
Findings represent a decline from prior level of function and must be of sufficient
severity to interfere with daily function
Impairment occurs in a clear sensorium. The presence of obtundation or stupor
suggests delirium
DELIRIUM
Epidemiology and risk factors
Delirium is often under-recognized by attending physicians and nurses
Delirium complicates hospital stays for at least 20% of elderly patients
Predisposing risk factors
Age greater than 65 years
Male gender
Predisposing cognitive impairment
Functional dependence
Sensory impairment (hearing or vision loss)
Dehydration
Polypharmacy
Preexisting neurological disease
HIV
Severe illness
Prevention strategies
Provide frequent reorientation
Mobilization as able
Nonpharmacological approaches before the use of antipsychotic drug
Prevention of sleep deprivation
Communication methods and adaptive equipment (eyewear, hearing aids) for sensory
impairment
Diagnosis
Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Note: To meet criteria, acute and fluctuating
course must be present with inattention plus either disorganized thinking or altered
level of consciousness
Acute and fluctuating course
Inattention
Disorganized thinking
Altered level of consciousness, usually manifested by a reduced awareness of
the environment. This disturbance may be hyperactive, marked by agitation and
vigilance, or hypoactive, marked by lethargy. Hypoactive delirium is easily missed
for days
516
GERI
Rely on multiple observations from caregivers, family, friends
Important features of physical exam include attention to oxygenation, urinary
retention, fecal impaction, dehydration, infection, or other signs of uncontrolled pain
Screen for deliriogenic medications. These may include
Hypnotics/benzodiazepines
Opiates
Anticholinergics
H2 antagonists
Steroids
Evaluate for possible withdrawal syndrome
Work-up
Consider CBC, BMP, calcium level, UA with cultures as appropriate. LP only with
clinical suspicion
Chest x-ray, EKG
Brain imaging may be performed but may be low yield in the absence of specific focal
neurological findings. Obtain CT head if history concerning for possible fall or head
trauma
An EEG may be considered for suspicion of atypical seizure
Treatment
Nonpharmacologic
Attempt to engage in activities of daily living
Remove restraints and Foley catheters if clinically feasible
Be sure eyeglasses and hearing aids are available and functional
Engage family/familiar items from home
Remove any obvious offending pharmacological agents or stimuli
Pharmacological measures
Haloperidol 0.5–2mg PO, IM, or IV
Consider atypical antipsychotics in select circumstances
Consider QT prolongation when using antipsychotics, including potential additive
effect from the current pharmacological regime
Avoid benzodiazepines unless treating withdrawal syndromes
DEMENTIA
Epidemiology
Incidence of dementia doubles every 5 years after age 60
Disease usually slowly progresses, with death often 8–10 years post-diagnosis
Although dementia is common with aging, it should not be considered part of the
normal aging process
Major subtypes of dementia
Alzheimer’s disease (AD): 65–75%
Onset is insidious and may not be detected in early stages
A subset of patients with cognitive defects not producing functional impairment
has been labeled mild cognitive impairment, with a typical conversion rate to AD
at a rate of approximately 12% per year
Vascular dementia: 15–25%
It may coexist with any degenerative dementia
Vascular disease is an independent risk factor for the development of dementia
with typical Alzheimer-like neuropathology
Lewy body dementia
Dementia with Parkinsonian features, memory component is present within the
first year of the movement disorder onset
Need to rule out other causes of Parkinsonism, including Parkinson’s disease,
medications, progressive supranuclear palsy
Frontotemporal dementia
Dementia with more pronounced features of behavioral disinhibition and impaired
judgment. Memory is relatively preserved during earlier stages
517
GERI
Often with earlier age of onset (45–65 years of age)
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may be useful in establishing this
diagnosis
These individuals may interface with the legal/criminal justice system until
properly diagnosed
Normal pressure hydrocephalus: Rare form of dementia, with a characteristic triad of
dementia, gait disturbance, and incontinence
Early intervention with shunting may significantly improve gait disturbance and
incontinence
Multiple other diseases and CNS toxic responses may present with cognitive
dysfunction including
Prion disease
Huntington chorea
Neoplasm
Encephalitis
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Metabolic disorders
Neurosyphilis
Thyroid disorders
Hypercalcemia
Vasculitis
Heavy metal toxicity
Approach to evaluation: History
Dementia is typically insidious and gradual in onset, with impairments in short-term
memory and ability to perform IADLs and ADLs present over several months to years
Need to rule out delirium (abrupt onset, waxing and waning of symptoms), mild
cognitive impairment in setting of uncontrolled depression, infection, metabolic
disorders, thyroid dysfunction
Thorough review of medications, including OTC medications and herbal medications
Identification of disturbances of behavior, delusions, suspicions, or hallucinations
Explore past medical history including vascular risk
Pertinent family history
Approach to evaluation: Physical exam
General appearance/hygiene
Attention to underlying cardiovascular disease
Neurological exam including level of alertness, strength, reflexes, gait/balance,
proprioceptive sense, vibratory sense, monofilament testing
Cognitive screening: Several widely used screening tools exist, each with positive and
negative aspects
Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE)
30 point questionnaire. Widely used. Tests broad range of cognitive functions
Limited by education level/age/language
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
One-page test with 30 total points. Tests multiple cognitive domains
More sensitive for mild cognitive impairment. Available in multiple languages
Limited by education bias. May take greater than 10 minutes to administer test
“Mini-Cog”
Consists of clock drawing and recall of 3 words
Developed for primary care setting. Short administration time. Limited education/
language/race bias
Different word lists may be used during test, may affect failure rates
St. Louis University Mental Status Exam (SLUMS)
30 point questionnaire
No education bias. Tests multiple domains
Only tested on predominately white males in VA setting during development, may
have cultural/race/gender bias
518
GERI
Lab and imaging
Consider CBC, BMP, TSH, Vitamin B12 serum, and liver function tests
Consider HIV, vasculitis screen, syphilis serology, and heavy metal screening as
clinically indicated
Lumbar puncture: Consider evaluating a rapidly progressive dementia and is required
to further evaluate a positive syphilis serology
Neuroimaging
MRI provides excellent anatomical detail
A non-contrast CT has the advantage of speed which may be appropriate for a
patient unable to follow directives
Functional imaging (PET/SPECT) may be of value in selective circumstances
such as frontotemporal dementia
Management: Nonpharmacological
Attention to home safety, including fall risk, fire hazards, wandering dangers and
potential for financial predators
The timing of driving cessation is critical for the patient and society. Consult:
Assessing and Counseling Older Drivers— www.nhtsa.gov
Consider new medical illness with abrupt change in behavior or cognition (e.g., UTI,
fecal impaction)
Be cautious of specific drug toxicity: Eliminate unnecessary medications (e.g., anti-
cholinergic agents, hypnotics)
Management of dementia: Pharmacological
Cholinesterase inhibitors, e.g., donepezil (Aricept)
Modest symptomatic benefit for cognition (may slow decline of MMSE from 3
points to 1.5 points after 1 year)
Improvement in non-cognitive symptoms may delay nursing home placement
All share potential for cholinergic symptoms, including nausea, diarrhea, anorexia,
and syncope
Consult Table on next page for specific agents
Early intervention appears reasonable to gain the most benefit
Memantine (Namenda), an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, is approved for moderate
to severe dementia: Constipating effect blends well with cholinesterase inhibitors
Ginkgo biloba: Has been suggested as beneficial but not FDA regulated
Vitamin E: 2005 trial found no benefit and may increase mortality
Atherosclerotic risk factors: Control hypertension and lipids per recommendations
Management of behavioral aspects of dementia: Pharmacological

CLINICAL PEARLS: DELIRIUM
Delirium is common and often unrecognized. Prevention is critical, and focused on
avoidance of precipitating factors
Pharmacological management of the symptoms of delirium is largely empirical. Goals
of management should be set based on goals of care, and adjustments based on clinical
response
Avoid benzodiazepines except in cases of alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal, be mindful
of antipsychotic side-effects including QTc prolongation.
Mortality rates among hospitalized patients with delirium range from 27–76%, statistics
comparable to acute myocardial infarction or sepsis
CLINICAL PEARLS: DEMENTIA
When the clinical course does not follow typical patterns, reconsider the differential
diagnosis
Be mindful of medication side-effects, including anticholinergic effects that could promote
delirium
When dementia with Lewy bodies is suspected, antipsychotic agents should be used with
caution due to marked sensitivity, including potential for neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Autonomic dysfunction, with the common manifestation of postural hypotension, is
common with advancing dementia and may increase risk of falls, behavioral disturbance
and lethargy
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with conventional or atypical
antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death
