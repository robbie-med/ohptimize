109. ALCOHOL AND OTHER
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
GENERAL
In 2013, an estimated 24.6 million Americans 12 years-old or older (9.4% of population)
reported using an illicit drug in the last month
Alcohol abuse costs the U.S. $224 billion/year, and illicit drug abuse costs $193 billion/
year
About 88,000 Americans die each year from alcohol-related causes (including traffic
accidents and cirrhosis)
More than 2 million people currently struggle from opiate addiction. In 2014, over 28,000
people in the United States died from opioid overdoses
Concomitant medical disorders are high among substance abuse patients and include
HTN, CAD, chronic liver disease, hepatitis C, depression, and anxiety
Definitions
Substance use disorder: A psychiatric diagnosis in DSM-V with standard diagnostic
criteria that span various substances, categorized as mild/moderate/severe
Physical dependence: A state of adaptation that is manifested by a withdrawal
syndrome that can be produced by an abrupt cessation of a substance or by tolerance to
the substance
Addiction: A primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and
environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations, characterized
by behaviors that include impaired control over substance use, compulsive use,
continued use despite harm, and craving (WHO Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms)
GENERAL EVALUATION OF ALCOHOL OR DRUG DEPENDENCE
Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT): An approach
recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
Screening quickly assesses the severity of substance use and identifies the appropriate
level of treatment
Brief intervention focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance
use and motivation toward behavioral change. Motivational interviewing is often used
during intervention
Referral to treatment provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment
with access to specialty care
Screening
Eliciting an alcohol and drug history
Ask patients: “Have you ever had a health, legal, or personal problem as a result of
alcohol or drugs?” and “When was your last drink or use of drugs?”
Answering “yes” to the first question and “within the last 24 hours” to the second
question is almost 95% sensitive for diagnosing alcoholism
Asking a patient “How much do you drink?” or “Do you use drugs?” often results
in dishonest answers
CAGE Questions: 2 out of 4 positive answers to the CAGE questions is also fairly
sensitive and specific for alcoholism
Have you ever tried to Cut down?
Do you get Annoyed when people question your drinking?
Do you feel Guilty about drinking?
491
PSYCH
Have you ever needed an Eye opener?
Other: Inconsistent mild hypertension, insomnia or anxiety, unexplained hepatitis or
cirrhosis, pancreatitis without stones
Laboratory abnormalities in patients with alcoholism
Elevated GGT (> 35 units)
High or high-normal MCV (> 95)
AST/ALT >2 (suggests alcohol-induced liver disease)
Serum uric acid > 7mg/dL
Serum triglycerides > 180mg/dL
EVALUATION & MANAGEMENT OF SEDATIVE (ALCOHOL &
BENZODIAZEPINE) DEPENDENCE
Signs and symptoms of withdrawal include sweating, anxiety/agitation, tremor, auditory
or visual disturbance, n/v, tactile disturbance, HA, disorientation, and at the most severe,
seizures. If patients have these symptoms on presentation, medications are indicated
Alcohol withdrawal seizures occur within 12–24 hours of stopping drinking. Alcohol
withdrawal delirium (DT’s) usually occurs 48–72 hours after cessation, mortality up to
20%. Sympathetic hyperactivity
Predictors of DTs: Prior history of severe withdrawal symptoms, high blood alcohol level
without signs of intoxication, withdrawal signs with high blood alcohol level, concurrent
use of sedative hypnotics, concurrent hepatitis, pancreatitis
Duration of symptoms: Peak in 72 hours and medications are generally not necessary
after 7 days (though patients may complain of difficulty with sleep for several weeks)
Medications
For alcohol withdrawal: Benzodiazepines are the preferred medication for treating
alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Please review, American Family Physician article
http://www.aafp.org/afp/2013/1101/p589.html for oral medications used to treat
alcohol withdrawal syndrome and fixed and symptom triggered dosing regimens. All
patients should be referred to a long-term treatment program to maintain abstinence.
Patients also need to be treated with Thiamine 100mg PO daily and Folic acid 1mg PO
daily
Treatment of alcohol dependence
Disulfiram (Antabuse)
Inhibits intermediate metabolism of alcohol, causing flushing, seating, nausea,
and tachycardia if patient drinks
The dose range is 125–500mg PO daily in morning. Patients must be abstinent
from alcohol for more than 12 hours prior to use
Side-effects include metallic taste, dermatitis, hepatotoxic effects, optic
neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, and psychotic reactions
Monitor LFTs and drug interactions. Avoid alcohol in diet, OTC medications,
or toiletries. Contraindicated with patients taking Metronidazole and those
with CAD
Acamprosate (Campral)
Stabilizes glutamate and GABA systems
The dose is 666mg PO every 8 hours. Reduce dose to 333mg PO every 8
hours in patients with CrCl 30–50mL/min
Side-effects include diarrhea, somnolence, rare cases of suicidality
Contraindicated in CrCl <30mL/min
Naltrexone: Blocks opioid receptors, reduces reward in response to drinking and
craving. Indicated for treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.
Side-effects include N/V, anorexia, HA, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, anxiety,
precipitation of opioid withdrawal, hepatotoxic effects at high doses
Oral Naltrexone: 50mg PO daily
Extended-release injectable Naltrexone (Vivitrol): 380mg IM every 4 weeks.
Side-effects are same as oral Naltrexone, plus injection reaction, joint pain,
muscle aches, depression, suicidality in rare cases, pneumonitis
492
PSYCH
Rehabilitation oriented treatment: At 1 year about 40–60% are continuously abstinent
and an additional 15–30% have not resumed dependent use. Predictors of poor adherence
include low socioeconomic status, co-morbid psychiatric conditions, and lack of support
system
EVALUATION & MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE
Signs and symptoms of withdrawal resemble a severe flu. Symptoms include pupillary
dilation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, piloerection (goosebumps), yawning, sneezing, n/v/d
Duration of symptoms
Heroin withdrawal: Peak in 36–72 hours and last for 7–10 days
Methadone withdrawal: Peak in 72–96 hours and for 14 days or longer
Medications: Decrease dose of Methadone by 3–5% each day
Buprenorphine (Subutex): SL tablets are used in office-based treatment by physicians
who are certified to prescribe these drugs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) website has information how to obtain a DATA 2000
waiver, and an opioid treatment program directory (https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-
assisted-treatment/become-buprenorphine-waivered-practitioner) and (https://dpt2.samhsa.
gov/treatment/directory.aspx)
Buprenorphine/Naloxone (Suboxone): Given as SL tab or SL film
Naloxone is a safety feature—if the person tries to use the medication IV, withdrawal
will occur. With sublingual use, only Buprenorphine gets absorbed, not the Naloxone
Buprenorphine is a high affinity partial agonist that binds tightly at the mu receptor.
Additional opiate use immediately after taking Buprenorphine will have little or no
CNS effect
Medication treatment for opioid withdrawal*
Medication
Opioid agonists: Methadone (20–35mg daily) or Buprenorphine (4–16mg daily),
tapered over several days or weeks
Withdrawal symptoms are decreased in severity
Methadone and other opioid agonists are currently restricted to inpatient
settings or licensed programs; Buprenorphine is now approved by the FDA for
this purpose
Nonopioid drugs: Clonidine (0.2mg PO TID) administered for approximately 10
days for Heroin and 14 days for Methadone
Rapid and ultra-rapid detoxification may be available in specific locations. Research
on efficacy is limited

and alcohol withdrawal. N Engl J Med 2003;348(18):1786-95)
Naltrexone: See Section E. above: Patients must be opioid free for 7–10 days prior to use
Medications for relief of symptoms
Abdominal cramping: Dicyclomine (Bentyl) 20mg PO every 6 hours as needed
Pain relief: Ibuprofen 600mg PO every 6 hours as needed or Acetaminophen 650mg
PO every 6 hours as needed
Diarrhea: Kaopectate 30cc PO every 6 hours as needed
Insomnia: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 25–50mg PO at bedtime as needed or
Melatonin 3mg PO at bedtime as needed
Rehabilitation oriented treatment: At 1 year about 40% are abstinent. Predictors of poor
adherence include low socioeconomic status, co-morbid psychiatric conditions, and lack of
support system
EVALUATION & MANAGEMENT OF STIMULANT (COCAINE &
AMPHETAMINE) DEPENDENCE
Signs and symptoms of withdrawal resemble depressive symptoms and include
dysphoria with disturbances in sleep and appetite. Severe symptoms may include paranoia,
delusions, compulsive behavior and may require Benzodiazepines or neuroleptics for the
first 48 hours. Irritability is very common
493
PSYCH
Duration of symptoms: Severe symptoms last 8–48 hours and minor symptoms may last
weeks to months. Relapse and depression are common
Medication treatment for stimulant withdrawal. No medications indicated for stimulant
withdrawal. Provide supportive care
CLINICAL PEARLS
Follow-up outpatient care is important in preventing relapses
Denial is an integral part of alcohol or drug abuse—family denial may be as strong as
patient denial
For every abuser there is an enabler—both need rehabilitation
AA, NA, cocaine anonymous are good free resources. Other resource for mental health:
