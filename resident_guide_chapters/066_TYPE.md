# 66. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
66. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
PREVALENCE (CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020)
Diabetes: 34.2 million people in the United States have diabetes (10.5% of the U.S.
population). Of these, 7.3 million people (21.4%) have undiagnosed diabetes
Prediabetes: In 2018, a total of 88 million adults (aged ≥18 years) had prediabetes
(34.5% of the adult U.S. population), based on their fasting glucose or A1c level
CLASSIFICATION
Type 1 diabetes (T1DM)
Autoimmune β-cell destruction, leading to absolute insulin deficiency
Immune mediated and idiopathic
Strong HLA associations with linkage to the DQA and DQB genes
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
Insulin resistance with progressive insulin secretory defect
50% of patients with T2DM present with end-organ damage at the time of diagnosis
As obesity rates in children have climbed, so has the incidence of T2DM among
adolescents and children
Gestational diabetes (GDM)
Diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with oral glucose tolerance
test
2–10% of pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by GDM
Diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal
diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY], cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis,
drug-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS or
after organ transplantation)
DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING
Diabetes is defined by the presence of (must meet one of the following)
Fasting plasma glucose ≥126mg/dL
Plasma glucose concentration ≥200mg/dL 2 hours after ingesting 75g oral glucose
Symptoms of hyperglycemia (i.e., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, unexplained
weight loss) AND random glucose ≥200mg/dL
HbA1c ≥6.5%
Prediabetes is defined by the presence of
Fasting plasma glucose 100–125mg/dL—OR—
2-hour plasma glucose 140–199mg/dL during 75g OGTT —OR—
HbA1c 5.7–6.4%
Per AACE/ACE diabetes guidelines, HbA1c 5.5–6.4% should signal more specific
testing with FPG or OGTT
For prediabetes, HbA1c testing should serve as screening tool, with FPG
measurement or OGTT being used as diagnostic
Screening for prediabetes and diabetes
For asymptomatic adults with the following
Overweight or obese per BMI
Age ≥45 years without other risk factors
Physical inactivity/sedentary lifestyle
First-degree relative with diabetes
High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian
American, Pacific Islander)
290
GEN
History of CVD
Hypertension (≥140/90mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)
HDL cholesterol level < 35mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or triglyceride level >
250mg/dL (2.82mmol/L)
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome
Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity,
acanthosis nigricans, NAFLD)
Patients with prediabetes (A1c ≥5.7%) should be tested yearly
Metabolic syndrome (according to National Cholesterol Education Program IV Adult
Treatment Panel III criteria) may be considered as a prediabetes equivalent
If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with
consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g., those with
prediabetes should be tested yearly) and risk status
Testing for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic children (age ≤18 years)
Screening for type 2 diabetes should be considered in children and adolescents who
are overweight and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes
Overweight is defined as BMI > 85th percentile for age and sex, weight for height >
85th percentile, or weight > 120% of ideal for height
Risk factors
Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child’s gestation
Family history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative
Race/ethnicity: Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American,
Pacific Islander
Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance
(acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, or
small-for-gestational-age birth weight)
Initiate testing at age 10 years-old or at onset of puberty, if puberty occurs at a younger
age
Test every 3 years
Diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
Screen for undiagnosed T2DM at the first prenatal visit in those with risk factors, using
standard diagnostic criteria above
Screen for GDM using one of the two following strategies
One-step (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups—
IADPSG consensus)
Screen at 24–28 weeks of gestation using a 75g OGTT (oral glucose tolerance
test)
The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of 8
hours or more
Measure plasma glucose at fasting and at 1 and 2 hour post OGTT. Use the
diagnostic cut points listed below
Fasting: ≥92mg/dL
1 hour: ≥180mg/d
2 hours: ≥153mg/dL
Two-step (NIH consensus)
Step 1: At 24–28 weeks of gestation, perform a nonfasting 50g GLT (glucose
load test) and measure plasma glucose at 1 hour after the load. If ≥140mg/dL,
go to step 2
Step 2: Perform a 100g OGTT when the patient is fasting. The diagnosis is
made when the plasma glucose at 3 hours after the test is ≥140mg/dL
The ACOG recommends a lower threshold of 135mg/dL in high-risk ethnic
minorities with higher prevalence of GDM
Glycemic goals in pregnant women with GDM
Preprandial: ≤95mg/dL, and—EITHER—
1 hour postmeal: ≤140mg/dL—OR—
2 hour postmeal: ≤120mg/dL
291
GEN
Screen women with GDM for persistent diabetes at 6–12 weeks postpartum, using
OGTT and non-pregnancy diagnostic criteria
Women with a history of GDM should be screened at least every 3 years
MANAGEMENT OF PREDIABETES
T2DM can be prevented or delayed with early multidisciplinary intervention
Management of cardiovascular risk factors should be a priority
Effective ongoing support program targeting weight loss of 5–10% of body weight
and increasing physical activity to ≥150 minutes/week of moderate activity (such as
walking)
Monitor and treat elevated blood pressure
Monitor and treat hyperlipidemia
Consider metformin therapy especially for those with BMI ≥35kg/m2, age < 60 years
women with prior GDM, and those with first-degree relative with DM
DIABETES CARE
A complete medical evaluation will assist the health care team to ensure optimal
management of the patient with diabetes
Major components of a comprehensive diabetes evaluation
Medical history (including vaccination history, review of medications, response to
treatment, notation of diabetes-related complications)
Comprehensive physical exam (including fundoscopic exam, thyroid exam, skin exam,
diabetic foot exam)
Lifestyle factors (including substance use history, physical activity, mental health
history, mood disorder screening, and social supports)
Laboratory evaluation
HbA1c
Urine microalbumin
Thyroid function
Lipid panel
Comprehensive metabolic panel
Referrals
Ophthalmology for annual diabetic dilated eye exam
Registered dietician for medical nutrition therapy
Dental
Mental health professional, if necessary

Frequency of A1c testing
Patients who are meeting treatment goals: Every 3–6 months
Patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals: Every
3 months, with titration of medications and/or insulin more frequently
Point-of-care testing for A1c offers opportunity for timely treatment changes
Correlation of A1c with average glucose
This table is provided as an information resource only and does not replace the use of clinical judgment.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
On multiple-dose insulin or insulin pump therapy: SMBG at least before meals
and at bedtime; occasionally postprandially, prior to exercise, when low BG is
suspected, after treating low BG until normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks
such as driving
On less frequent insulin injections or noninsulin therapies: SMBG may be used to
guide treatment decisions and/or patient self-management
AAFP recommends against daily blood glucose self-monitoring for patients with
type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin. Patients should still have access to a
glucometer and monitor periodically based on risk for hypo/hyperglycemia
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may be used in T1DM, those with
hypoglycemia unawareness, and/or those with frequent hypoglycemic episodes
Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes
Individuals at risk for hypoglycemia should be asked about symptomatic and
asymptomatic hypoglycemia at each encounter
Classification of hypoglycemia
Level 1
Hypoglycemic alert value
Glycemic criteria: ≥54 and < 70mg/dL (3–3.9mmol/L)
Description: Low enough for treating with fast-acting carbohydrate and
adjustment of dose of glucose-lowering therapy
Level 2
Clinically significant hypoglycemia
Glycemic criteria: < 54 (3mmol/L)
Description: Low enough to indicate serious hypoglycemia requiring
immediate action to resolve
Level 3
Hypoglycemic alert value
Glycemic criteria: No specific glucose threshold
Description: Hypoglycemia associated with altered mental state, cognitive
impairment necessitating external assistance to recover
Treatment of hypoglycemia
Glucose (15–20g) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with
blood glucose ≤70mg/dL. Fifteen minutes after treatment, if SMBG shows
continued hypoglycemia, the treatment should be repeated. Once SMBG returns
to normal, the individual should consume a meal/snack to prevent recurrence of
hypoglycemia

GEN
Glucagon should be prescribed for all patients at increased risk of clinically
significant hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia unawareness or ≥1 episodes of severe hypoglycemia should trigger
reevaluation of the treatment regimen
Insulin-treated patients with an episode of clinically significant hypoglycemia should
raise their glycemic target for at least several weeks in order to reduce risk of future
episodes
Clinicians should increase their vigilance for hypoglycemia in patients with low
cognition or declining cognition
Diabetes self-management education (DSME)
DSME should be provided to all patients when diabetes is diagnosed and as needed
during annual assessment of education, nutrition, and emotional needs, when new
complicating factors influence self-management, and when transitions in care occur
DSME has been shown to reduce A1c by as much as 1%, delay diabetes complications,
and improve quality of life in patients with diabetes. In addition, better outcomes have
been shown to be associated with the amount of time spent with a diabetes educator
DSME may also be provided to people with prediabetes
Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)
Refer patients to a registered dietitian who should also be a certified diabetes educator
(CDE). Goal is to educate on meal planning and healthy food choices
There is not a one-size-fits all eating pattern for individuals with diabetes, and meal
planning should be individualized. A variety of nutrient-dense foods in appropriate
portion size should be emphasized to improve overall health
The Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and plant-based
diets are examples of healthful eating patterns
The diabetes plate method provides a visual guide for basic meal planning. A smaller
plate is used to control calories. Limit carbohydrates to what fits in one-quarter of the
plate, with emphasis on low-carbohydrate (or non-starchy) vegetables
Recommend weight loss > 5% for obese patients with T2DM
Limit alcohol intake (≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 drinks/day for men) and take
precautions to prevent hypoglycemia
Food availability should be queried, as well as other cultural circumstances that could
affect dietary patterns
Physical activity
At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50–70%
of maximum heart rate), spread over ≥3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive
days without exercise
If no contraindication, perform resistance training ≥2 ×/week
Prolonged sitting should be interrupted every 30 minutes by briefly standing, walking,
or performing other light physical activities
Flexibility training and balance training are recommended 2–3 ×/week for older adults
with diabetes. Yoga and tai chi may be included based on individual preference
Patients with specific long-term complications of diabetes
Patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy should undergo cardiac evaluation
before beginning physical activity that is more intense than what they are
accustomed
Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or severe non-PDR should
not do vigorous aerobic or resistance exercise because of the risk of triggering
vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment
Patients with peripheral neuropathy should wear proper footwear and examine
their feet daily to detect lesions early
Patients with a foot injury or open sore should be restricted to non-weight-bearing
activities
Smoking cessation
Advise all patients not to use cigarettes or e-cigarettes
Assess for tobacco use and provide smoking cessation counseling
294
GEN
Psychosocial assessment and care
Assessment of psychological and social situation should be an ongoing part of the
medical management of diabetes, with the goals of optimizing health outcomes and
health-related quality of life
Psychosocial screening and follow-up include attitudes about the illness, expectations
for medical management and outcomes, affect/mood, general and diabetes-related
quality of life, resources, and psychiatric history
When self-management is poor, consider screening for depression, diabetes-related
distress, anxiety, eating disorders, and cognitive capacities
Consider screening older adults (aged ≥65 years) with diabetes for cognitive
impairment and depression
Collaborate with behavioral and mental providers and refer appropriate patients for
treatment
Immunizations
Annual influenza vaccination for all diabetic patients
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 (PPSV23, Pneumovax) for all diabetic
patients (≥2 years of age)
A one-time revaccination at/after age 65 (use a minimum interval of 5 years
between PPSV23 doses)
Repeat vaccination in those with nephritic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and
other immunocompromised states (e.g., after transplantation). Use a minimum
interval of 5 years between PPSV23 doses
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13, Prevnar 13)
Routine childhood vaccination at ages 2, 4, 6 and 12–15 months
Routinely in adults aged ≥65 years
PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be given at the same visit. Adults aged ≥65 years
should receive PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 1 year later. If the
patient is immunocompromised, the first dose of PPSV23 can follow the PCV 13
dose by 8 weeks
Hepatitis B vaccination for adults aged 19–59 years with diabetes
3-dose series: 0, 1, 6 months
Diabetics aged ≥60 years may be vaccinated at the clinician’s discretion
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Hypertension (HTN)
General information
Present in 20–60% of patients with diabetes
In T1DM, HTN is often the result of underlying nephropathy
In T2DM, HTN usually coexists with other cardiometabolic risk factors
Screening
Measure BP at every visit
Diagnose HTN when BP elevated in 2 separate days
Goals
< 140/90mmHg for most patients with diabetes and HTN
< 130/80mmHg may be appropriate for individuals at high risk of cardiovascular
disease, if it can be achieved without undue treatment burden
120–160/80–105mmHg for pregnant patients with diabetes and preexisting HTN
who are treated with antihypertensive therapy
Treatment
Patients with BP > 120/80mmHg: Lifestyle modification (weight loss if
overweight or obese; DASH diet, moderation in alcohol intake; and increased
physical activity)
Patients with BP ≥140/90mmHg: Lifestyle modification and initiation of drug
therapy
Patients with BP ≥160/100mmHg: Lifestyle therapy and initiation of two
antihypertensive agents
295
GEN
Drug therapy
The drug regimen should include drug classes that demonstrated reduction of
cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide-
like diuretics, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers)
Multiple-drug therapy is generally required to achieve BP goals. However,
combinations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs or combinations of ACE inhibitors or
ARBs with direct renin inhibitors should be avoided
ACE inhibitor or ARB is the first-line treatment for HTN in patients with diabetes
and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥300mg/g or 30–299mg/g creatinine. If
one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted
Monitor serum creatinine or eGFR and serum potassium levels if ACE inhibitor,
ARB, or diuretics are used
Note:ACE inhibitors,ARBs, and spironolactone are contraindicated during pregnancy
Antihypertensive agents that are effective and safe in pregnancy: Methyldopa,
Labetalol, and long-acting Nifedipine
Hydralazine may be considered in the acute management of HTN in
pregnancy or severe pre-eclampsia
In patients with resistant HTN (not at BP targets despite 3 classes of
antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic), consider adding a mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonist
Dyslipidemia
Prevalence
Increased in patients with T2DM
Contributes to high risk of ASCVD
Monitoring
Obtain a lipid profile at time of diabetes diagnosis, at an initial medical evaluation,
and every 5 years thereafter if < 40 years of age
Obtain a lipid profile at initiation of statins or other lipid-lowering therapy, 4–12
weeks after initiation or a dose change, and annually thereafter
Lifestyle intervention is recommended for all patients with diabetes
Reduce saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake
Increase dietary n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber (e.g., oats, legumes, and citrus), and
plant stanols/sterols intake
Weight loss if overweight
Increase physical activity
Statin therapy
Statins are the drugs of choice for LDL cholesterol lowering and cardioprotection
Two statin dosing intensities are recommended
High-intensity statin therapy lowers LDL cholesterol by ≥50%. Atorvastatin
40–80mg and rosuvastatin 20–40mg are high-intensity statins
Moderate-intensity statin therapy lowers LDL cholesterol by 30–50%.
Moderate-intensity statins are: Atorvastatin 10–20mg, rosuvastatin 5–10mg,
simvastatin 20–40 mg, pravastatin 40–80mg, lovastatin 40mg, fluvastatin XL
80mg, and pitavastatin 2–4mg
Primary prevention
Age < 40 years: Little data exists. Moderate-dose statin therapy may be
considered based on risk-benefit profile and presence of ASCVD risk factors.
ASCVD risk factors include LDL cholesterol ≥100mg/dL, high blood
pressure, smoking, chronic kidney disease, albuminuria, and family history of
premature ASCVD
Age ≥40 years: Moderate-dose statin therapy is recommended. High-intensity
statin therapy may be considered if additional ASCVD risk factors are present
Secondary prevention
High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all patients with diabetes
and ASCVD
296
GEN
If LDL cholesterol ≥70mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin dose, add
a non-statin LDL-lowering therapy (e.g., ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor).
Ezetimibe may be preferred due to lower cost
Adults aged < 40 years-old with prevalent ASCVD were not well represented
in clinical trials of non-statin based LDL reduction. Before initiating
combination lipid-lowering therapy, consider the potential for further ASCVD
risk reduction, drug-specific adverse effects, and patient preferences
Hypertriglyceridemia
Fasting triglyceride levels ≥500mg/dL: Evaluate for secondary causes, address
dietary and lifestyle changes including abstinence from alcohol
Severe hypertriglyceridemia > 1,000: Pharmacologic therapy (fibric acid derivates
and/or fish oil) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis
Combination therapy (statin/fibrate and statin/niacin) is generally not recommended
due to the lack of additional CV benefit above statin therapy alone and additional side-
effects
Note: Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy
Antiplatelet agents
Aspirin: 75–162mg/day
Primary prevention
Generally not recommended. Can consider Aspirin therapy in those with
T1DM or T2DM who are at increased CV risk (10-year risk > 10%). This
includes most men and women with diabetes aged ≥50 who have at least
one additional major risk factor (family history of CVD, HTN, smoking,
dyslipidemia, or albuminuria) and are not at increased risk of bleeding
Use clinical judgment to determine the need for Aspirin therapy in patients
with moderate CVD risk (10-year 5–10%)
Aspirin is not recommended in diabetic adults at low CVD risk (10-year risk
< 5%)
Secondary prevention: Use Aspirin in those with diabetes with history of CVD
Clopidogrel: 75mg/day should be used in patients with CVD and documented Aspirin
allergy
Aspirin (75–162mg/day) and Clopidogrel (75mg/day) as dual antiplatelet therapy is
reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome and may have benefits
beyond this period
Coronary heart disease
Screening: In asymptomatic patients, routine screening is not recommended
Treatment
In patients with known CVD, consider ACE inhibitor or ARB, to reduce the risk of
cardiovascular events
In patients with prior MI, continue β-blockers for at least 2 years after the event
Avoid Thiazolidinedione (Pioglitazone [Actos]) in patients with symptomatic heart
failure
Metformin may be used in patients with stable CHF if CrCl > 30mL/minute; but
should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with CHF
Among patients with T2DM with established ASCVD or established kidney
disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin, canagliflozin) or GLP-1 receptor
agonist (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) with demonstrated CVD benefit is
recommended
In patients with established heart failure, an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin,
canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) may be considered to reduce risk of heart failure
hospitalization
In patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, antihyperglycemic
therapy should begin with lifestyle management and metformin and subsequently
consider adding empagliflozin or liraglutide to reduce major adverse
cardiovascular events
297
GEN
MANAGEMENT OF MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS AND FOOT CARE
Diabetic kidney disease
General information
Diabetic kidney disease occurs in 20–40% of patients with diabetes and is the
leading cause of ESRD in the U.S.
Optimize glucose control and BP control to reduce the risk or slow the progression
of nephropathy
Screening
Annual assessment of urine albumin excretion and eGFR in
T1DM with diabetes duration ≥5 years
All T2DM starting at diagnosis
All patients with comorbid hypertension
Definitions of abnormalities in albumin excretion
Screen for increased urinary albumin excretion with urinary albumin to creatinine
ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection
Normal: < 30mg/g creatinine (Cr)
Increased urinary albumin excretion: ≥30mg/g Cr
Historically, ratios between 30 and 299 have been called microalbuminuria and ≥
300 have been called macroalbuminuria (clinical albuminuria)
Exercise within 24 hours, infection, CHF, marked hyperglycemia, and marked
hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values
Two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be
abnormal before considering a patient to have developed increased urinary
albumin excretion or have a progression in albuminuria
eGFR is routinely reported by laboratories with serum Cr, using a validated formula
(CKD-EPI)
When eGFR < minute/1.73m2, evaluate and manage potential complications of
chronic kidney disease
In patients with reduced eGFR, dosing of some drugs may need to be modified.
Refer to Table 3 for diabetes drugs requiring renal dose adjustment
eGFR and evidence of kidney damage are used to stage the level of chronic kidney
disease (CKD)
Treatment
For patients with T2DM and CKD, consider SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin,
canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) in patients with eGFR ≥30mL/minute/1.73m2 and
urinary albumin > 30mg/g Cr to reduce risk of CVD progression and/or CV events
In patients with CKD who are at increased risk of CV events, use of GLP-1
receptor agonist (liraglutide) may reduce risk of progression of albuminuria, CV
events, or both
In nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension, an ACE inhibitor or ARB
is recommended for those with modestly elevated UACR (30–299 mg/g Cr) or
higher levels (≥300mg/g Cr) and/or eGFR < 60 mL/minute/1.73m2
In hypertensive T1DM with any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have
shown to delay the progression of nephropathy
In hypertensive T2DM with microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors and ARBs
have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria
In T2DM with hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency
(serum creatinine > 1.5), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of
nephropathy
An ACE inhibitor or ARB is not recommended for the primary prevention of
diabetic kidney disease in patients with diabetes who have normal BP, normal
UACR (< 30mg/g Cr), and normal eGFR
Monitor serum creatinine and serum potassium when using ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, or diuretics
Dietary protein intake
298
GEN
For patients with non-dialysis-dependent diabetic kidney disease, the
recommended daily allowance should be 0.8g/kg/day
For patients on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be
considered to help preserve muscle mass and function
Continue to monitor UACR in patients with albuminuria treated with an ACE
inhibitor or ARB to assess response to therapy and progression of disease
Referral to nephrology in patients with advanced kidney disease
Diabetic retinopathy
General information
Prevalence is related to the duration of diabetes and the level of glycemic control.
Other risk factors include chronic hyperglycemia, diabetic kidney disease,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia
Most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20–74 years in
developed countries
Glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders occur earlier and more frequently in
patients with diabetes
Optimize glycemic control, as well as BP and serum lipid control, to reduce the
risk or slow the progression of retinopathy
Screening
T1DM: An initial dilated and comprehensive eye exam within 5 years after the
onset of diabetes
T2DM: Initial dilated and comprehensive eye exam at the time of diabetes
diagnosis
Frequency of exam: Annually for T1DM and T2DM patients
Less frequent exams (every 1–2 years) may be considered if no retinopathy is
present for one or more annual eye exams
More frequently if retinopathy is progressing
Pregnancy is associated with a rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy. Women
with pre-existing diabetes (T1 or T2) who are planning pregnancy or who have
become pregnant should have
A comprehensive eye examination and be educated on diabetic retinopathy
Eye exam should occur before pregnancy or in the first trimester in patients
with preexisting diabetes, and then patients should be monitored every
trimester and for 1 year postpartum as indicated by the degree of retinopathy
High-quality fundus photographs can detect most clinically significant diabetic
retinopathy. A trained eye care provider should interpret the images
Retinal photography may be used as a screening tool
It is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam
Treatment
Prompt referral to ophthalmology specialists
Panretinal laser photocoagulation therapy is the traditional standard treatment used
to reduce vision loss in high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and in
some cases of severe non-PDR
Intravitreous injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis), an anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor (anti-VEGF), have been approved to reduce the risk of vision
loss in patients with PDR. The approval was based on a study that intravitreous
ranibizumab injections are not inferior to traditional panretinal laser
photocoagulation
Intravitreous injections of anti-VEGF are indicated for central-involved diabetic
macular edema, which occurs beneath the foveal center and may threaten reading
vision. There are currently 3 anti-VEGF agents approved for this indication:
Bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept
Aspirin therapy for cardioprotection does not increase the risk of retinal
hemorrhage. Aspirin is not contraindicated in patients with retinopathy
Neuropathy
Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)
299
GEN
All T1DM 5 years after the diagnosis and at least annually thereafter
All T2DM starting at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter
Assessment for distal symmetric polyneuropathy should include a careful history and
assessment of either temperature or pinprick sensation (for small fiber function) and
vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function)
All patients should have annual 10g monofilament testing to identify feet at risk
for ulceration and amputation
Assess symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy in patients with microvascular
complications
Treatment
Optimize glucose control to prevent or slow the progression of neuropathy
Treat patients to reduce pain related to DPN
Drugs approved for the treatment of pain related to DPN
Duloxetine (Cymbalta): 60mg daily
Pregabalin (Lyrica): 50mg TID
Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, tramadol, and
topical capsaicin may be effective for treating painful DPN
Foot care
All patients with diabetes should have an annual comprehensive foot exam to identify
risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations
Obtain a prior history of ulceration, amputation, Charcot foot, angioplasty or vascular
surgery, cigarette smoking, retinopathy, and renal disease
Assess current symptoms of neuropathy and vascular disease (leg fatigue,
claudication)
All patients with diabetes should have their feet inspected at every visit
Foot exam should include
Inspection of the skin
Assessment of foot deformities
Palpation of pedal pulses
Neurological assessment. Testing for loss of protective sensation (LOPS): 10g
monofilament plus testing any one of the following
Vibration using a 128-Hz tuning fork
Pinprick sensation
Temperature
Ankle reflexes
All patients with diabetes should receive general foot self-care education
A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for patients with foot ulcers and high-
risk feet
Refer patients who smoke, have LOPS and structural abnormalities, or have history
of prior lower-extremity complications to foot care specialists for ongoing monitoring
and lifelong surveillance
Initial screening for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) should include a history for
claudication and an assessment of the pedal pulses. Consider obtaining an ankle-
brachial index (ABI)
Refer patients with significant claudication or a positive ABI for further
assessment and treatment
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with diabetic foot ulcers has mixed evidence
supporting its use as an adjunctive treatment to enhance wound healing and prevent
amputation

PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT
Pharmacologic therapy
Oral therapies
Biguanides: Metformin
Sulfonylurea (2nd generation)
Meglitinides (Non-Sulfonylurea)
Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones)
α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI)
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) inhibitors
Bile acid sequestrants (Colesevelam)
Dopamine-2 agonists (Bromocriptine)
Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
Oral combination products
Metformin is available in many combination products with a 2nd generation
sulfonylurea, a TZD, a DDP4 inhibitor, or SGLT2 inhibitor
Combination products are often used to improve adherence by reducing pill
burden
Parenteral therapies
Amylin analog
GLP-1 receptor agonists
Insulin (Basal, Bolus)
Types of available insulin products have different onset, peak, and duration of
action
Rapid-acting and short-acting insulin products are used in bolus (mealtime)
therapy
Intermediate and long-acting insulin products are used as basal therapy
The concentration of most insulin products is 100 units/mL
Humulin R U-500 (500units/mL) has been available for some time. Recently,
a few concentrated insulin preparations (200, 300units/mL) are also available
for patients requiring consistently high daily doses of insulin. To avoid dosing
error, newer concentrate insulin preparations provide measured doses in an
insulin pen delivery system
New insulin products have advantages of less risk of hypoglycemia and
patient convenience in dosing. However, the high cost of these products is
becoming a major barrier for patients to receive appropriate treatment
Premixed insulin products
Premixed combination of NPH or NPH with rapid-acting or short-acting insulin
preparations (70/30 mix) provide convenience for basal-bolus regimen and reduce
the number of injections but lack dosing flexibility
Premixed combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 agonist products reduce the
number of injections. Their effect on medication adherence has yet to be proven
Therapeutic strategies (Note: For a detailed outline in chart form of this topic, See Figure
9.1 and Figure 9.2 in the ADA’s Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes–2020, Diabetes
Care 2018;43(S1):S103-104
Initiate drug therapy based on A1c
9% consider monotherapy
A1c ≥9%, consider Dual therapy. A combination of two oral agents or with insulin
may be necessary
301
GEN
A1c ≥10%, BG ≥300mg/dL, or patient is markedly symptomatic, consider
Combination Injectable Therapy. Insulin should be considered at the outset. As the
patient’s glucose toxicity resolves, the regimen may, potentially, be simplified
Monotherapy
Metformin, if no contraindication, is the preferred and most cost-effective first
drug. To minimize GI side-effects, metformin should be started at a low dose with
gradual titration. Consider Metformin XR to minimize GI side-effects
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73m2
and should not be initiated for patients with eGFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73m2
Long-term use of metformin may be associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency.
Periodic measurement of Vitamin B12 levels should be considered in metformin-
treated patients, especially in those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy
In patients with metformin contraindications or intolerance, consider an initial
drug from another class: SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, DPP4 inhibitors,
thiazolidinediones, AGI, and 2nd generation sulfonylureas. Choice of drug should
be based on drug-specific effects and patient factors
Monitor A1c after 3 months of monotherapy. If A1c is not at target, assess
medication-taking behavior and consider Dual Therapy
Dual therapy
In patients without ASCVD, consider a combination of Metformin and any one
of the preferred 6 treatment options: Sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP-4
inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin. The choice of
a second drug is based on drug-specific effects and patient factors
For patients with ASCVD, add a second agent that is proven to reduce major
adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality: Empagliflozin
(SGLT2i) and Liraglutide (GLP-1 RA)
If HF or CVD predominates (particularly HFrEF), start with SFLT2i with
evidence of reducing HF and/or CKD progression
If SGLT2i is not tolerated or contraindicated, choose GLP-1 RA with proven
CVD benefit
If desire to minimize weight gain/promote weight loss, trial GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i
If cost is major issue, trial sulfonylurea or TZD
Monitor A1c every 3–6 months. If A1c is not at target after 3 months of dual
therapy, assess medication-taking behavior and proceed to triple therapy
Triple therapy
A combination of metformin plus two additional agents
Use drugs with complementary mechanisms
Insulin usually provides the most robust response at this juncture where many
patients would have progressive β-cell loss
Again, if A1c is not at target after 3 months of triple therapy, proceed to
combination injectable therapy
Combination injectable therapy
Basal insulin: Add 1 rapid-acting insulin injection before largest meal. If A1c not
controlled, advance to basal-bolus (3 rapid-acting insulin injections before meals)
Basal insulin: Add GLP-1 RA. If goals not met, consider changing to 2 injection
insulin regimen
Basal insulin: Change to premixed insulin twice daily (before breakfast and
dinner). If A1c not controlled, advance to 3rd injection (premixed analog insulin
breakfast, lunch, dinner)
Insulin therapy
Basal insulin
Long-acting basal analogs or NPH alone is usually the most convenient initial
insulin regimen in conjunction with 1 or 2 oral agents
Long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine or detemir) can be used instead of NPH
to reduce the risk of symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia
Dosing
302
GEN
Start at 10units per day or 0.1–0.2units/kg/day, depending on the degree of
hyperglycemia
Give long-acting insulin (Lantus or Levemir) once daily or NPH at bedtime
Titrate by 2–4 units (or increments of 10–15%) once or twice weekly to reach
FBG target
As the target is neared, dosage adjustments should be more modest and occur
less frequently
If hypoglycemia occurs with no clear reason, decrease dose by 4 units or
10–20%
Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is important during this phase
Prandial or mealtime insulin (typically the rapid insulin analogs)
If FBG is at target but A1c is > 7%, add prandial insulin to on-going basal insulin
(basal-bolus therapy)
First step is to get more SMBG data to verify that postprandial hyperglycemia is
occurring (e.g., > 180mg/dL)
Two approaches
Gradual approach over several weeks
Add the first prandial insulin before the biggest meal, often the evening
meal. Then, a second prandial insulin can be added before the meal with
the next glucose excursion, often breakfast. Finally, a third prandial
insulin is added before the smallest meal, often lunch
Start with 4units, 0.1units/kg, or 10% basal dose. If A1c < 8%, consider
For hypoglycemia with no clear reason, decrease corresponding dose by
2–4units or 10–20%
Progression from basal insulin to a twice-daily premixed insulin (before
breakfast and evening meals)
Divide current basal dose into ⅔AM, ⅓PM or ½ AM, ½ PM
Increase dose by 1–2units or 10–15% once or twice weekly until SMBG
target reached
For hypoglycemia with no clear reason, decrease corresponding dose by
2–4 units or 10–20%
Insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides) are typically stopped once basal-bolus
regimens are utilized

INSULIN DOSING
Basal-bolus insulin regimens
Dosage calculations for multiple dose injection (MDI)
First, estimate the patient’s total daily dose of insulin (TDD) TDD = 0.4–0.5units/
kg/day × patient’s weight (kg)
Second, calculate the basal insulin dose
Glargine or Detemir or NPH dose = TDD × 50%
Third, calculate the insulin coverage for each meal (Humalog, Novolog, Regular)
Pre-meal insulin dose = TDD × 50% ÷ 3
Fourth, calculate the corrective insulin ratio (supplemental scale)
1800 ÷TDD = fall in blood glucose per 1unit of Humalog or Novolog 1500 ÷TDD
= fall in blood glucose per 1 unit of regular insulin, or use:
An arbitrary carb:insulin ratio (CIR): 1unit per 50mg/dL. An arbitrary insulin:carb
= 1:15g of CHO
Twice-daily, mixed insulin regimen

Dosage calculations
First, estimate the patient’s total daily dose of insulin (TDD)
TDD = 0.4–0.5units/kg/day × patient’s weight (kg)
Second, calculate the dose before breakfast (AM dose)
AM dose = TDD × ⅔(⅔as NPH and ⅓as rapid- or short-acting insulin)
Third, calculate the dose before dinner (PM dose )
PM dose = TDD × ⅓(½ as NPH and ½ as rapid- or short-acting insulin)
Other considerations
Use lower starting dosage in patients who have normal weight, are physically active,
or have unusual eating habits, in elderly, or those with severe renal impairment
SMBG: fasting, pre-meal or 2 hour post-meal, and bedtime
Insulin dose adjustment
Writing insulin prescriptions and ordering supplies
Write insulin name in full. Avoid abbreviation “U” for units
Insulin is available in 10mL vials of 100units/mL concentration. Each vial contains
1000units
Some insulin products are also available in disposable pens (300U/3mL); 1 box= 5
pens
Useful for patients who have difficulty drawing up accurate doses
Disposable pens require single-use needle tips in 100/box (29, 30, 31, 32 gauge),
needle length: 8, 6, 5, 4mm
Insulin syringes package in boxes of 100. They are available in sizes of 0.3mL (30U),
0.5mL (50U), 1mL (100U). Needle size: 29, 30, 31 gauge; needle length: 12, 8, 6mm
(no pitch if use short needles)
Freestyle Libre: Sensor (order 2 per month because have to change every 14 days),
reader (order 1 with 0 refills)
Patient can also download Libre app on smart phone
Freestyle Libre 2 can be set to sound alarm if patient’s blood glucose goes above/
below programmed number
Testing supplies: Glucometer, test strips (1 box = 50 or 100 strips), lancets (1 box =
100 lancets), alcohol wipes in boxes of 200
Refer the patient for diabetes education
CLINICAL PEARLS
Diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease that requires a multidisciplinary treatment
approach and ongoing patient self-management of the disease
Comprehensive CV risk reduction must be a major focus of therapy. Care should be
focused on treatment of blood pressure, glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking
cessation
Select appropriate medication management to reach patient-specific goals
Glycemic targets and hypoglycemic therapies must be individualized to meet the patient’s
needs
Diet and lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of T2DM treatment
Metformin is recommended as the first-line drug. It is common to require 2–3 drug
combinations to achieve glycemic control. Ultimately, many patients with T2DM will
require insulin therapy
