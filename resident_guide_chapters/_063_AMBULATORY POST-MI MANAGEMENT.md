63. AMBULATORY POST-MI MANAGEMENT
IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR FUTURE EVENTS POST-
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI): Patients at high risk, consider cardiology referral
and cardiac catheterization
Poor left ventricular (LV) function (EF < 45%): By ECHO or cardiac catheterization.
Patients with an EF of 20–44% have a 12% 1-year mortality
Recurrent ischemia post-MI
Multiple cardiac risk factors: Post-MI patients with 4 risk factors have ~ 60% 2-year
mortality
Location and extent of infarct: Anterior infarct has highest 1-year mortality
Ventricular arrhythmias: If a patient has > 10 PVCs/hour compared to < 1 PVC/hour, the
1-year mortality is 18% compared to 3% (indication of poor LV function)
Number of vessels with atherosclerotic disease: 1-year mortality is increased from 2 to
12% with triple vessel disease compared to single vessel disease
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Most patients will have at least 1 of these 3 tests before hospital discharge
Stress testing: Submaximal testing 4–6 days post-MI or symptom limited at 10–14 days.
See Chapter 48, Cardiac Stress Testing. This should be followed with a maximal stress
test 3–6 weeks post-MI. If either is positive, cardiac catheterization should be strongly
considered
Cardiac ECHO: To assess LV function and ejection fraction, wall motion, valves, septal
defects, papillary muscle function. If the prehospital discharge ECHO shows LV dys-
function (EF < 45%), patients should be strongly considered for cardiac catheterization
Cardiac catheterization: The gold standard test recommended for patients at high risk of
future events or if above tests are positive
INDICATIONS FOR CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION/STATISTICS
Of 100 patients admitted with acute MI
20 patients will have severe ischemia or severe pump failure during their hospital
admission. Recommendation: Cardiac catheterization
20 patients will become symptomatic during a submaximal stress test prior to hospital
discharge. Recommendation: Cardiac catheterization
10 patients will become symptomatic during maximal stress testing 3–6 weeks post-
discharge. Recommendation: Cardiac catheterization
The remaining 50 patients will be at low risk with a 0–5% 1-year mortality. One half
of the remaining 50 patients will undergo cardiac catheterization within 1year. Medical
management and risk factor modification should be aggressively pursued
MANAGEMENT
Risk factor modification post-MI: Strongly encourage treatment, compliance, and/or
behavioral modification of the following risk factors. Patients with 4 risk factors have a
2-year mortality which is 60% compared to 5% in patients with 1 risk factor (See related
Chapters)
Smoking: Cessation post-MI reduces subsequent cardiac mortality by ~50%
Hypertension: Reduction of mortality by 20% with successful reduction of blood
pressure
Diabetes: Presence of diabetes increases 1-year mortality post-MI by 25%

GEN
High cholesterol: Target LDL post-MI is < 70mg/dL
Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, depression
Cardiac rehabilitation: Most post-MI patients will benefit, although the extent of
rehabilitation will have to be tailored to a patient’s specific situation. Mortality may be
decreased by up to 25% with participation in cardiac rehab
Care coordination: Growing emphasis is being placed on care coordination between
specialists and the PCP for close monitoring post-MI to prevent readmission to the
hospital. Goals of coordinated care include improved communication between physicians,
medication reconciliation, and providing education/resources to the patients and their
families to improve therapy adherence post-hospitalization
Medical management post-MI (Medications with proven efficacy to decrease mortality
include aspirin, Clopidogrel (Plavix), ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors/statins)
Aspirin: Indicated for all patients unless allergic. Peptic ulcer disease is not a
contraindication
The ISIS 2 trial showed that Aspirin reduced vascular death by 23% and reduced
nonfatal infarctions by 49% post-MI
Aspirin would save 5,000 lives/year if given to all post-MI patients, yet as many
as 28% of post-MI patients do not receive it. Aspirin has an approximate cost of
$13 per life saved (dose: 81mg/day)
Consider Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg/day for 1 year or indefinitely if aspirin
contraindicated
ß-blockers
The ß-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) showed that ß-blockers (which reduce
the heart rate) reduced sudden death by 32%, recurrent infarction by 27%, and
overall cardiac mortality by 22% post-MI. The benefit is more pronounced in
patients with co-morbid factors of angina, prior heart failure or arrhythmia
Should be administered within hours post-MI
Avoid Labetalol and intrinsic sympathomimetics such as Acebutolol and Pindolol
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Studies suggest a reduction in
incidence of sudden cardiac death and nonfatal subsequent infarctions following
myocardial infarction. ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that ACE inhibitors should
be started within 24 hours post-MI with continuation of chronic treatment for those
patients with anterior MI, HF, or LVEF of 40% or less. Use ARBs in patients who are
intolerant of ACE inhibitors
Statins
High intensity statin recommended for all patients post ACS, regardless of LDL
level
For further guidelines and drug doses/side-effects,etc., See Chapter 58, Hyperlipidemia
Anticoagulants: Indicated when there are other conditions that would benefit from
treatment with oral anticoagulation (example: atrial fibrillation)
Nitrates: If a patient has to use PRN nitrates post-MI, strong consideration should be
given to cardiac catheterization if it has not been performed
Calcium channel blockers
Should not be used for secondary prevention post-MI except possibly in non-Q-
wave MI where the EF has been preserved and there is no evidence of CHF
Nifedipine should not be used post-MI as it has been shown to increase mortality
Antiarrhythmics: Although effective at suppressing ventricular ectopy, the CAST
study showed that certain antiarrhythmics increased mortality post-MI. Therefore, they
should not be routinely used post-MI
CLINICAL PEARLS
In first year after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), mortality ranges from 6–19%.
Subsequent mortality is 3–4% /year
There is early evidence that stopping a statin on admission to the hospital for acute MI
increases mortality
