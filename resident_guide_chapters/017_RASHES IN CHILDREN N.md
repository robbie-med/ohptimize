17. RASHES IN CHILDREN
Note: See Chapter 96, Describing Dermatologic Lesions, for description and diagrams of
different rashes
MACULOPAPULAR EXANTHEMS
Measles (Rubeola) low incidence due to immunization
Incubation: 10–14 days
Prodrome: Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, 3 days high fever; child appears toxic
Exanthem: Fever peaks when rash appears—erythematous macules and papules ap-
pear on upper neck and face, then begin to progress down to extremities and become
confluent. Petechial eruption may appear on the soft palate 1–2 days before rash
followed by Koplik’s spots (blue-white macules with surrounding erythema found
on the buccal mucosa adjacent to the second molars). Rash co-exists with fever and
leukopenia and lasts 7–10 days
Lab: Measles IgM antibody at least 3 days after onset of rash
Management: Supportive and control pain caused by oral ulcers
Acetaminophen
Topical viscous Lidocaine—apply with a cotton-tipped swab several times daily
Mixture of Diphenhydramine, Mylanta and Carafate: swish and spit
Management: Supportive
Rubella
Incubation: 14–21 days
Prodrome: Nonspecific respiratory symptoms and lymphadenopathy (postauricular,
suboccipital)
Exanthem: Pink, begins on face and progresses downward, lasts 2–3 days, and fades in
reverse direction
Complications: Arthritis common in women after 2–3 days of illness (knee, wrist,
finger), encephalitis, thrombocytopenia
Virus can be isolated from throat or urine up to 2 weeks after onset of rash
Management: Supportive—isolate patient from pregnant women (virus is highly
teratogenic if exposure occurs in first trimester)
Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease—Parvovirus B19)
Incubation: 7–14 days, occurs in winter-spring epidemics in school-age children
Prodrome: None
Exanthem
Stage I. Red-flushed cheeks with circumoral pallor (slapped cheek)
Stage II. Maculopapular eruption on proximal extensor surfaces of extremities spreads
distally and often to trunk, neck and buttocks. Palms and soles are spared (lacelike)
Complications: Arthritis, aplastic crisis
Management: Supportive
Roseola (Human herpes virus—Type 6): Occurs in children age 6 months to 3 years
Incubation: 10–14 days
Prodrome: 3–4 days of high fever which precedes rash; child looks great despite fever
Exanthem: Macules with secondary erythema which appear when fever breaks.
Initially seen on chest, it spreads to involve face and extremities. Lymphadenopathy
may be present (suboccipitally)
Complications: Febrile seizures
Management: Supportive
Scarlet fever (Group A B-hemolytic streptococci)
Incubation: 2–4 days. Follows pharyngitis or skin infection
55
PEDS
Prodrome: 1–2 days of fever, vomiting, sore throat; toxic appearing
Exanthem: Erythematous, sandpaper texture; starts on neck, axillae, inguinal areas and
then spreads to rest of body. Petechiae in antecubital and axillary skin folds (Pastia’s
Lines) are helpful in making diagnosis. Lasts 7 days and then desquamates. Can also
see red strawberry tongue
Complications: Rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis
Management: Penicillin—See Chapter 10, Pharyngitis, for dosage information
Hand, foot and mouth disease (enteroviruses: Coxsackie virus a16, a5, and a10)
Incubation: 4–6 days (exposure through enteric route; oral-oral or fecal-oral)
Prodrome: Low-grade temperature, sore throat, malaise, lymphadenopathy
Exanthem: Aphthae-like lesions anywhere in the mouth followed by 3–7mm red
macules on palms and soles. These develop into cloudy vesicles with red halos. Can
also see mild peri-orbital edema
Complications: None
Management: Supportive including viscous Lidocaine and Diphenhydramine elixir—
both swish and spit
Kawasaki’s disease (Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome)
Incubation: Unknown
Prodrome: Abrupt, high spiking fever (101–104ºF), unresponsive to antipyretics.
Occasionally diarrhea, cough or abdominal pain
Exanthem: Within 3 days of fever
Bilateral bulbar conjunctival congestion
Erythematous mouth and pharynx with strawberry tongue and red, cracked lips
Edema of the hands and feet with erythema of the palms and soles
Cervical lymphadenopathy
Generalized rash that can be morbilliform, maculopapular, scarlatiniform or may
resemble erythema multiform
Complications: Arthritis, meningitis, coronary, aneurysm (20–25%)
Management: Supportive care, detection of coronary disease and anti-inflammatories
(IVIG and Aspirin). Hospital admission
Lyme disease
Etiology: Vector-borne illness caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted
by bite of Ixodes scapularis tick (deer tick)—size of pin head
Prodrome: Erythema migraines develop in about 80% of patients with disease and
appear 2–20 days after bite. May be accompanied by fever, chills, myalgia, headaches,
arthralgia
Exanthem: Appears at site of inoculation as enlarging erythematous macular rash with
central clearing
Complications: Secondary and tertiary illness may involve facial palsy, chronic
arthritis, myocarditis, axonal polyneuropathy, and encephalopathy
Treatment of early infection
Doxycycline (not recommended for children < 8 years-old) ≥8 years-old: 2mg/kg
BID. Max 100mg/dose
Amoxicillin: 50mg/kg/day in 3 doses. Max 500mg/dose
Cefuroxime (Ceftin): 30 mg/kg/day in 2 doses. Max 500mg/dose
Routine prophylaxis
VESICULAR EXANTHEM
Chickenpox (varicella zoster virus)
Incubation: 10–20 days
Prodrome: Malaise; low grade fever
Exanthem: Develops over 3–6 day period usually starting along hairline of face; each
lesion begins as a macule that progresses to a papule and vesicle and finally a crusted
vesicle; rash emerges in crops over the trunk and finally the extremities; lesions in
different stages are present throughout the first week

PEDS
Complications: Bacterial infection of vesicular lesions, pneumonia, hepatitis, arthritis,
glomerulonephritis, CNS disease
Prevention: Routine immunization with varicella vaccine (Varivax) in children ≥12
months of age: 2 doses SC at ≥4 weeks apart
Management
Cut patient’s fingernails short to prevent scratching and secondary infection
Wash lesions BID with soap and water
Benadryl, cold washcloth or oatmeal baths (Aveeno bath) will help decrease
itching
Routine use of antiviral agent in healthy children is not recommended
Acyclovir (Zovirax) should be considered in
Severe infection in infants and immunocompromised children: 10mg/kg every
8 hours IV × 7 days
Healthy children with severe infection and children receiving high-dose
steroid or long-term salicylate therapy: 20mg/kg 4 ×/day PO × 5 days
Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (Human), VARIZIG is indicated for post-
exposure prophylaxis in high risk individuals. Dosing of VARIZIG is based on
body weight
Post-exposure varicella vaccination: ACIP recommends that after being exposed
to varicella, people who do not have evidence of immunity and are eligible for
vaccination should get varicella vaccine. The vaccine is effective in preventing
chickenpox or reducing the severity of the disease if administered within 3 days,
and possibly up to 5 days, after exposure
Rhus dermatitis (poison ivy)—See Chapter 97, Contact Dermatitis
PETECHIAL RASH
Meningococcemia
Etiology: Meningococci are gram-negative organisms which contain endotoxins in
their cell walls
Prodrome: Cough, headache, sore throat, nausea, vomiting (all may be of very short
duration prior to rash appearing). Patient usually appears toxic
Rash: May be maculopapular in early stages. Purpura and petechiae are seen over the
extremities and trunk
Complications: Acute purulent meningitis, DIC, septic arthritis, pericarditis
Differential: H. flu, pneumococcus, enterovirus, rickettsial disease, Henoch-Schoenlein
purpura, and blood dyscrasias can all cause a similar petechial rash
All children who are ill-appearing and febrile with a petechial rash should be
hospitalized until meningococcemia is ruled-out
Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Incubation: 3–12 days after tick bite
Etiology: Tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. Dogs and rodents are
reservoirs. Transmission requires tick attachment for greater than 6 hours; occurs most
commonly along eastern seaboard, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas
Prodrome: High fever, severe headache, myalgia, shaking rigor, photophobia, nausea
Exanthem: Typically develops around fourth day of illness. Begins as pink macules
on wrists, forearms, ankles, palms, and soles, and then spreads centrally within 6–18
hours to arms, thighs, trunk, and face. Within 2–4 days, lesions become petechial
Complications: Splenomegaly, conjunctivitis, edema, irritability, and confusion.
Mortality rate is 5–7% due to severe vasculitis
Treatment: Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for adults and children of all ages.
Dosage: < 45kg: 2.2mg/kg given BID × 7–14 days; ≥45kg: 100mg BID
CLINICAL PEARLS
VZV vaccine if used within 3–5 days postexposure of household or hospital contact may
abort infection and reduce symptoms
The management of most rashes in children is supportive—rule out the “life threatening”

causes of rashes with a thorough history and physical exam
Most petechial rashes are caused by viruses
Risk of Lyme disease transmission is small with ticks attached < 48 hours, and
significantly increases with attachment > 72 hours
