# Conclusion and Recommendation

For a relational, pre‑clinic teaching encounter limited to 15 minutes, Resident’s Guide chapters should serve as the primary instructional resource.

## Rationale

- **Time-fit design**: Resident’s Guide chapters average roughly half the length of comparable Amboss articles (mean ~1,229 vs ~2,494 words; median ~1,119 vs ~2,167), making them realistically teachable within brief pre‑clinic sessions.
- **Accessible complexity**: Readability metrics favor Resident’s Guide (Flesch‑Kincaid ~14.1 vs ~15.8; Gunning‑Fog ~18.0 vs ~19.8), supporting efficient comprehension in time‑constrained, discussion‑focused teaching.
- **Content efficiency**: Resident’s Guide shows higher concept density (about 8.0 vs 5.9 unique lemmas per sentence; about 115 vs 80 entities per 1,000 words), indicating more clinical information delivered per unit time—ideal for guided teaching when paired with faculty explanation.

## Instructional Application

Use Resident’s Guide as the core pre‑session material. Integrate targeted Amboss excerpts selectively when additional narrative framing, updated guidance, or deeper reference support is specifically needed. Full Amboss articles are less suitable as default assignments for short sessions.

## On Currency and References

Amboss content is modestly more current and reference‑dense. However, these strengths do not translate into superior effectiveness for teaching foundational material in brief, relationship‑centered educational encounters.

## Final Perspective

Educational optimization in this setting should be defined as alignment with purpose: appropriate length, outpatient relevance, clarity, and sufficient depth without cognitive overload. By those criteria, Resident’s Guide provides the most reliable baseline for 15‑minute pre‑clinic teaching, with Amboss functioning best as a focused adjunct rather than a primary text.
